## Project health

1. What areas and/or subprojects does your group need the most help with?
   Any areas with 2 or fewer OWNERs? (link to more details)

   - [Optimizing kubectl memory usage](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/issues/978).
   - [Kustomize only has two maintainers](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/OWNERS_ALIASES#L4-L6).
   - Our docs, which are joint for Kustomize and Kubectl, need some love. They are built off [cli-experimental](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-experimental), are outdated and need SEO improvements. The sites aren't in the first several pages of Google results for "kustomize docs" / "kubectl docs". The donated kustomize.io and kubectl.io sites/domains need to be integrated as well.

2. What metrics/community health stats does your group care about and/or measure?

   - [Open untriaged issues and PRs](https://cli.triage.k8s.io/s/kubectl).
   - New reviewers and approvers added.

3. Does your [CONTRIBUTING.md] help **new** contributors engage with your group specifically by pointing
   to activities or programs that provide useful context or allow easy participation?

   - No this document is out of date and difficult to maintain. We need to update it and model it after some other groups.

4. If your group has special training, requirements for reviewers/approvers, or processes beyond the general [contributor guide],
   does your [CONTRIBUTING.md] document those to help **existing** contributors grow throughout the [contributor ladder]?

   - Weâ€™re working with SIG-Apps on starting a monthly review club, details to be announced soon.

5. Does the group have contributors from multiple companies/affiliations?

   - Yes all of the leads are from different companies and we see a spread of contributions from other companies. That said we would love to see further investment.

6. Are there ways end users/companies can contribute that they currently are not?
   If one of those ways is more full time support, what would they work on and why?

   - Kustomize is in need of new maintainers. Ideally folks that depend on it daily and able to jump right in.
   - kubectl is a large tool and we need new folks to stick around and learn its different pieces.

New in 2021:
- [KRM Functions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-cli/README.md#krm-functions)

Continuing:

  - Open sourced "terminal as notebook" support. Example: https://playground.guidebooks.dev/
  - 1500 -> 2100 stars
  - User study of user preference for kubectl versus web consoles with [@algebrot](https://github.com/algebrot) (Cora Coleman). Summary of findings:
    > We found that among a survey of 60 cloud developers (beginner, intermediate, expert), all strongly prefer using the CLI modality for completing CRUD and debugging tasks and only the intermediates and experts prefer using a different tool modality (web console) for monitoring tasks. Similarly we observed strong preference for the CLI among four developers that completed a task using the CLI and the web console
