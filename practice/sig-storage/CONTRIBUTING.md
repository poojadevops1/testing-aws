Keep in mind that these artifacts reflect the state of the art at the time they were created. In Kubernetes we try very hard to maintain backwards compatibility, but Kubernetes is a fast moving project and we do add features going forward and attending the Storage SIG meetings and the Storage SIG Google group are both good ways of continually staying up to speed.

### How to help

We love having folks help in any capacity! We recommend you start by reading the overall [Kubernetes contributor's guide](/contributors/guide)

### Helping with Features
If you have a feature idea, please submit a feature proposal PR first and put it on the [Storage SIG Meeting Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8KEG8AjAgKznS9NFm3qWqkGyCHmvU6HVl0sk5hwoAE/edit#heading=h.bag869lp4lyz).
Our PR review bandwidth is fairly small, as such, we strongly recommend that you do not start writing the implementation before you've
discussed the feature with the community. This helps the community understand what you're trying to do with the proposal and helps the
community and you work through the approach until there is consensus. The community then will also be able to communicate with you how
soon they will be able to review your proposal PR, to set expectations. However, generally speaking once the your proposal PR is merged,
your implementation PR review and merge should go fairly quickly as the review is  focused on the implementation quality and not
what you are proposing. We are really trying to improve our test coverage and documentation, so please include functional tests, e2e tests
and documentation in your implementation PR.

### Helping with Issues
A great way to get involved is to pick an issue and help address it. We would love help here. Storage related issues are [listed here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asig%2Fstorage+).

### Adding support for a new storage platform in Kubernetes
For folks looking to add support for a new storage platform in Kubernetes, take a look of the [CSI Drivers Doc](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/). The CSI Drivers Doc website documents how to develop, deploy, and test a [Container Storage Interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) (CSI) driver on Kubernetes. [CSI Hostpath Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-host-path/blob/master/README.md) is a demo implementation and is used for CSI testing.

Also see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-storage/volume-plugin-faq.md) for deprecation notices regarding in-tree volume plugin and out-of-tree FlexVolume driver.
