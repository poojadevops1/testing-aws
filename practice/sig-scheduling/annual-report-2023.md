# 2023 Annual Report: SIG Scheduling

## Current initiatives and Project Health

1. What work did the SIG do this year that should be highlighted?

  - Refine the schedulerâ€™s APIs to provide more options that cater to diverse infrastructure and workload requirements. This includes continuing improvements on the PodTopologySpread API and applying the same approach to the PodAffinity API.
  - Explore fine-grained (re-)queuing directives to enhance scheduling efficiency. This involves introducing new controls for developers to implement custom logic for determining how and when a pod should be (re-)queued.
  - Stabilize core scheduling while enhancing its extensibility with external components.

2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?

  None.

3. Did you have community-wide updates in 2023 (e.g. KubeCon talks)?

  Yes. SIG-Scheduling provided the following updates:
  - [KubeCon EU 2023](https://sched.co/1HySx)
  - [KubeCon NA 2023](https://sched.co/1R2rr)
