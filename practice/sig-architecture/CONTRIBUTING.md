There are also various [Working groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-architecture#working-groups) and [Subprojects](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-architecture#subprojects) meetings where new contributors are always welcome.

Contributions are made via Pull requests.  Before opening a pull request, contributors must sign the [CNCF Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md)
