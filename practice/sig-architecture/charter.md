# SIG Architecture Charter

This charter adheres to the conventions described in the [Kubernetes Charter README] and uses
the Roles and Organization Management outlined in [sig-governance].

## Scope

The Architecture SIG maintains and evolves the design principles of Kubernetes, and provides a consistent body of expertise necessary to ensure architectural consistency over time.

### In scope

#### Code, Binaries, Docs, and Services

- *Conformance test definitions*
- *API definitions*
- *Architectural renderings*
- *API conventions*
- *Design principles*
- *Deprecation policy*
- *Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) process*
- *Upgrade and downgrade policy*
- *Cross-component version support skew*

#### Cross-cutting and Externally Facing Processes

- API review process
- Conformance test review and management
- Design documentation management
- Deprecation policy management
- Architectural initiative backlog management

### Out of scope

- KEPs that do not have architectural implications or impact are managed by their respective sponsoring SIG(s)
- The release enhancement delivery [process] that is part of the SIG-Release Release Team [subproject]

## Roles and Organization Management

This sig follows and adheres to the Roles and Organization Management outlined in [sig-governance]
and opts-in to updates and modifications to [sig-governance].

### Additional responsibilities of Chairs

- Manage and curate the project boards associated with all sub-projects ahead of every SIG meeting so they may be discussed
- Ensure the agenda is populated 24 hours in advance of the meeting, or the meeting is then cancelled
- Report the SIG status at events and community meetings wherever possible
- Actively promote diversity and inclusion in the SIG
- Uphold the Kubernetes Code of Conduct especially in terms of personal behavior and responsibility
