# SIG F2F Guidelines for Contributor Summit Barcelona 2019

SIG Chairs should register interest in a F2F for the Contributor Summit in Barcelona on Monday, May 20th 2019. **Important: We will try to accommodate all requests, but space is limited. UPDATE: We are at room capacity and cannot accept new requests.** Details about status of accepted F2F meetings can be found in [Issue #3358](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3358)

## How are SIG F2F meetings different from SIG Deep Dives and Intros being held during KubeCon?

* These SIG F2F meetings should be solely focused on contributors, whereas the deep dives and intros are for discussions with consumers, users, and contributors.
* For example, the F2F meetings would be a good place to discuss issues internal to your SIG to work on processes and other issues that have the biggest impact on contributors.

## What we will provide

* Tables and chairs in dedicated rooms.
* Breakfast, lunch and other refreshments throughout the day.

## What we will NOT provide

* We cannot confirm access to a projector / beamer.
* F2F meetings will not have audio or video recordings.
* Each SIG is responsible for setting their own agenda and providing any content required.

## Request Form

The form is now closed, but the information requested is mentioned here for historical purposes.

**Information required:**

* Name of person requesting F2F.
* Your primary email.
* GitHub Handle.
* SIG Name.
* Approximate number of attendees.
* What do you plan to do during your F2F (a couple of bullets / sentences is fine)?
* What do you hope to walk away with after the F2F has concluded?
