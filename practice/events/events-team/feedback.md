We have been collecting feedback in some shape or form since we started doing Contributor Summits from both attendees as well as our awesome set of volunteers. 
The feedback is an integral part of our content creation and overall experience of the event. 
This doc captures these for
historical and future planning purposes.

Thanks to all who have provided feedback in the past.
