# SIG F2Fs

## Overview

At *some* Contributor Summits, we will have space available for SIGs to hold in person meetings for contributors. In most cases, these
are like the normal SIG Zoom meetings, but in person. Note that these meetings are
just for SIG contributors, and don't replace the intro and deep dive meetings held during KubeCon for users.

As SIG F2F Lead, you are responsible for reaching out to SIGs to find out which ones would like to hold meetings, and then managing the
space available to make sure that we stop accepting new requests when we run out of space.

Time Commitment

  - 1-3 hours a week in the 2 months prior to the event.

## Responsibilities

- Put together a request form to gather requests and find out how much time they require and how many people they expect.
- Promote this request form to the SIGs in our regular SIG chair emails.
- Work with the event staff to understand the space available.
- Coordinate with the New Contributor Workshop and other Contributor Summit organizers to make sure that these meetings do not overlap with other activities, especially the SIG Meet and Greet.
- Place SIGs in rooms at specific times being careful to put SIGs at different times if they are likely to overlap in membership.
- Communicate room placement / times back to the SIGs and ask them to promote their meeting within their SIG.
- Make sure that the F2F activities are on the schedule with a brief description of the purpose of these meetings.
