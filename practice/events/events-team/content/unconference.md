# Unconference Handbook

## Overview

The Unconference Lead is responsible for managing the unconference process, from session proposals to group selection to scheduling unconference sessions.  The lead must decide how session proposal and selection will work at this particular summit, and then carry it out, driving participation as well.

If there are other types of content at the Summit, the Unconf lead will coordinate on sessions and schedules.
