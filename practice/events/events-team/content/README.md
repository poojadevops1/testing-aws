# Content SubTeam

The Content subteam of the events team is responsible for programming and content for periods
of the contributor summit.

The membership of this team depends on the activities that will actually take place during that
particular Contributor Summit.  As such, there are a variety of roles, but not all roles
will be present for all Summits.  The mix of content is generally determined by the Content Coordinator
and the Event Lead in the first 2-3 weeks of event planning, so many of these roles
will be chosen after that.

All roles may have shadows.  Click the role name for that role's Handbook.
