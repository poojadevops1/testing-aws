    )

BGrant: Need help formalizing the proposal process, it’s not documented,
need to automate assignment of the proposals, reach out to Brian Grant -

-   Q: Don’t we want to stop taking features? A: We’ll take the idea,
    but not necessarily implement

Anecdote: IBM has struggled with how to contribute Lots of cross-SIG
implementations, needs improvement Containerization growth 3% to 15% in
a year Lower number than expected of companies doing orchestration ECS
is at the top

-   Q: Does Docker mean the docker runtime? A: Yes. Not swarm or orch
    tools, data is very consistent across surveys - means we need to be
    a strong community and understand the roadmap implications of the
    users. Last docker survey said people use Docker for development

Aparna: We’re aware of the developer experience, but it needs more
attention

Node has a huge surface area, and we saw in Borg as well. Every feature
touches node/API Machinery 

M Rubin: Perception piece that it’s easy to tie something to node, so it’s an easy place to throw things 

BGrant:Need to take that into account when triaging 

BGrant: check out Istio

MRubin: Need to look at HPC more 

Bburns: More conflict re: numa vs.
stable kubernetes 

Etune: The list was not authoritative 

Bburns: Are we after people with “deep pockets” or are we after the community? 

Jbeda:
work on decoupling over prioritizing new features in the wrong direction

R Hirschfeld: the initial build experience is very important to overall
community health 

M Rubin: need to make deprio clear, and why Need to
make it clear that we’re working on first getting things out of k/k SIGs
have the ability to set the roadmap 

BGrant: lots of critical features
that big users need i.e. RBAC, in beta over introducing new APIs, some
users will not use non-GA features
