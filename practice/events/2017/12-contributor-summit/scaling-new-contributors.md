# Scaling New Contributors
*Lead: Vishnu Kannan*  
*Notetaker: Chris Love*

New pull requests are plateauing in k/k
Takes much longer for a PR to get through

Contributor Experience
3 mo for PR merged - minor PR that was a fix
Nobody reviewed - was ignored
PRs are lacking process to get them on milestones
Lack of organization and understanding PR process
There is a need for a sig buyin
We have a explicate state machine, instead of a implicate state machine
We do have a well defined process for new contributors to follow
We need to have committed resources to a PR, 
File an issue first, then file a PR
When the needs sig is there, the issue will be processed and you can find out which sig

What is the problem
No time to review PRs

Mentoring Program
Mentoring program overview
Common theme is that we do not have time to review PR
Bootcamps for new contributors

Lot of Common Complaints

Tests did not pass what happened
Devstats
Everyone needs to look at the stats
We are currently bottlenecked at approvers not reviews

How to fix the problem
SIG Leads are too busy
Have another role within the sigs for mentors
Can we label the issues in terms of complexity
Sig-cli has it documented in a contributor guide
Incentivizing mentoring
How do we help take the load off of the approvers pool, how do we improve reviews
How many times a reviewer say lgtm
Reviewer performance
We need to document what a good review looks like
Guidance on progress to contributor -> reviewer -> maintainer
How does maintain a good citizenship in the community
Put the documentation into kubernetes.io
Simple use-case examples on how to get a PR in
Give contributors some responsibilities
Planned workshop on how to get a PR merged
Contributor based workshop
Ask questions on #kubernetes-dev
We need to document how to get answers
We need to move our documents into kubernetes.io
Sigs may not want to have new contributors
We need to cleanup those who are inactive in k/k - OWNERS and MAINTAINERS
How do we create incentives?
If they are autosigned an issue and do not respond - we need to measure that metric
How do we fix the release process in terms of what is in a release, because we do not have a target we do not know what we are shooting at
We need to figure out what new contributors are working on
Start off by using kubernetes then become contributors
