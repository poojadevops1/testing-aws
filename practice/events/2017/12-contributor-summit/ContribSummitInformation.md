## Invitations:
Selected attendees are Kubernetes upstream contributors including SIG members and lottery winners from a [members of standing](/community-membership.md) pool.
We realize that this is not the best approach now that our community is growing in exponential ways. In 2018, we will be unfolding a new strategy for bringing our contributors together so all voices can be heard.

Invites went out on October 19th. There are ten spots left. Please reach out to parispittman@google.com to claim one.

## Format:
"loosely-structured unconference"  
Rather than speakers and presentations, we will have moderators/facilitators and discussion topics, alongside all-day completely unstructured hacking.

The discussion sessions will be in an open fishbowl format — rings of chairs, with inner rings driving the discussion — where anyone can contribute. The various sessions will be proposed and voted on by the community in the weeks leading up to the event. This allows the community to motivate the events of the day without dedicating precious day-of time to choosing the sessions and making a schedule.

There will be 2 rooms dedicated to these sessions running in parallel all day. Each session should last between 45 minutes and an hour. There will be a smaller room available for unstructured discussion all day.

## Call for Topics:
Call for topics and voting is now closed. You can view the complete list of proposed topics and abstracts [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1miMinwk3Cp_4KV0xj36gIT3XdN4JtDcnAhkLZxG-qCQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Desired Outcomes:
* Generate notes from the sessions to feed the project's documentation and knowledge base, and also to keep non-attendees plugged in
* Make (and document) recommendations and decisions for the near-term and mid-term future of the project
* Come up with upcoming action items, as well as leaders for those action items, for the various topics that we discuss


## Misc:

A photographer and videographer will be onsite collecting b-roll and other shots for KubeCon. If you would rather not be involved, please reach out to an organizer on the day of so we may accommodate you.
