## Project health

1. What areas and/or subprojects does your group need the most help with?
   Any areas with 2 or fewer OWNERs? (link to more details)

   - Additional reviewers (and eventually approvers) on [Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow)
   - Many less-active tools in test-infra, such as:
     - [Boskos](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/boskos)
     - [Kettle](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/kettle)
     - [Kubetest2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubetest2)

2. What metrics/community health stats does your group care about and/or measure?

   - Reviewers and approvers

3. Does your [CONTRIBUTING.md] help **new** contributors engage with your group specifically by pointing
   to activities or programs that provide useful context or allow easy participation?

   - Yes! See [k8s/sig-testing: Contribution](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-testing#contribution) and [k8s/test-infra: Issue Triage](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issue-triage).

4. If your group has special training, requirements for reviewers/approvers, or processes beyond the general [contributor guide],
   does your [CONTRIBUTING.md] document those to help **existing** contributors grow throughout the [contributor ladder]?

   - N/A: no special training, requirements, or processes.

5. Does the group have contributors from multiple companies/affiliations?

   - Yes.

6. Are there ways end users/companies can contribute that they currently are not?
   If one of those ways is more full time support, what would they work on and why?

   - (_more reviewers, promoting active reviewers to approvers?_)
   - (_to be filled_)
