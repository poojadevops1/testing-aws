this is the future home for hosting instructions: monthly sig chair/tl meeting  

1. make sure both timezones are booked on the calendar. contact contribex chairs
if there is a problem.
2. add the date and host name to the meeting [agenda]  
3. start curating the agenda based on previous templates  
    - welcome and intros to those new to the call first   
    - relevant community news  
    - previous meeting recap, questions, and discussion. this is helpful to
      sync the discussion points from other timezone friendly meetings and
      review actions/ongoing work to keep everyone on the same page  
    - recruit someone to do a how to topic and make the discussion in a similar
      category. parking lot of ideas is at the top of the agenda. solicit
      agenda items from the chairs/tls
4. send agenda to chairs/tls on the mailing list and slack channel
