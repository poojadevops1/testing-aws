### Ideas

- Have a #ncw channel on Slack. The first person who finds the Slack channel with the most members, or the longest name(etc) and posts in here wins a prize!
- Everyone introduces their neighbor and a cool Kubernetes fact about them in a Slack or Discuss channel/topic.
- Put an easter egg in the mailing list and whoever discovers it first by joining and reading the discussions, wins a prize!
- Come up with the most creative TL;DR for the CoC.
