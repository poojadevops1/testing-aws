# Live Workshops Resources

## Overview

This folder contains the [handbook for the New Contributor Workshop Content Lead](./new-contributor-workshop-lead.md) as well as playbooks for each of the Contributor Workshop sessions in a live setting.

This workshop is held periodically by the Kubernetes Community, but materials and processes may be used at contributor focused summits and events anywhere.

Slides from previous New Contributor Workshops can be found [here](https://github.com/cncf/presentations/blob/master/kubernetes/README.md#kubernetes-new-contributor-workshops).
