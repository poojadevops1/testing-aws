## Live PR Demo

### Duration

Plan for about 30 minutes

### Task Overview

Demonstrate opening a pull request against the [Kubernetes/Kubernetes](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes) (k/k) repository. There are some docs cleanup good-first-issues, but feel free to show off something you've been working on for a while.

### Slides

None; this is a live demo.

### Details To Cover 

- Make sure to prepare code in advance but only commit locally
- Show the k/k pull request workflow
- Show the PR templates and fill them out, explaining why
- Interact with the bot and briefly mention labels/OWNERS files
- Leave room for questions, but be aware that the workflow will be covered in depth later.

### Ideas
- ask the audience or a pre-planned reviewer for code review, showing more of the k/k automation
