## Finding Your First Issue

### Duration

20 minutes

### Task Overview

Set participants on as much of a paved path to contributor success as possible.
At this point in the workshop, participants should know what kind of issue they want to tackle.

### Slides

Refer to previous workshops for inspirations

### Details To Cover 

- help-wanted and good-first-issue labels
- Up and coming sandbox projects
- Working with your SIG
- Refer participants to specific SIGs
- How to "claim" an issue (since non-members cannot self-assign)
- Path to [membership](/community-membership.md)

### Ideas

- Give folks time to discuss and help each other
- Gather information from SIGs in advance (via Slack, Twitter...) on who needs help, and at what level
- Prepare a list of issues and assign folks right there
- Connect participants to mentoring tracks if available (e.g. Release Team Shadow)
