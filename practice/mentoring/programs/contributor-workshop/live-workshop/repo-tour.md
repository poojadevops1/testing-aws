## Repo Tour

### Duration

10 - 15 minutes

### Task Overview

Show that Kubernetes is not just about the Core Repository, but also about the other repos in the org and in kubernetes-sigs.

### Slides

Have a few overview slides, but also go off-book and live show the repos on GitHub.

### Details To Cover 

- k/website, k/test-infra, k/community, k/enhancements, with explanations
- Exciting things in kubernetes-sigs


### Ideas

- Ask participants if they have found or are interested in specific repos, and share about their purpose.
- Mention which repos need help, or have awesome good-first-issue shepherding from maintainers!
