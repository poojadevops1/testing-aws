## Host Instructions
TODO: elaborate here and upload example comms  

Want to host in another timezone? Reach out to us on the #sig-contribex slack
channel!  
0. Recruit a live streamer from sig-contribex  
1. Recruit panelists (3-4) that represent a mix of backgrounds, sigs, and experience
levels. Look to devstats contributor dashboards for most recent releases to get
folks who are active in the project. You don't want all of the same voice; please
make this as diverse as possible.
2. Send panelists the zoom link calendar invite and a prep email. Tell the panelists
to help advertise on the mailing lists and networks.
3. Advertise. Send a note to k-dev, request a tweet from social@cncf.io, post in
#k-dev, #meet-our-contributors, and #sig-contribex slack channels
4. Confirm with everyone a few days before. We always have at least one person that
can no longer accommodate with their schedules and will need a back up or know
that you will be one less.
5. Tweet and get the word out in the AM (ask others to tweet for you!) of the show
6. Have panelists meet 5 minutes early for the streamer to test audio.
7. While testing, go over the agenda for the panelists, give them a chance to ask
questions, also give them a heads up on questions that have already come through
so they can think of responses a head of time.
8. Start the show!
9. Show agenda:
- Welcome to x month's Meet Our Contributors!
- Intro yourself (brief, name usually and that you are the host)
- We have a code of conduct! ... talk about where to find it, be excellent across
x platforms, if someone needs to report conduct@kubernetes.io
- Go over instructions on how to ask questions and panelists can ask each other
questions
- State: "Our agenda today as always: intros, announcements, and q&a!"
- Ask panelists to do introductions (no order, just call out names). They can take
up to 5 minutes if they go into their background.
- Converse freely with the panelists so its not boring Q&A. As host should only
answer a question if other panelists are done or no one has a response.
