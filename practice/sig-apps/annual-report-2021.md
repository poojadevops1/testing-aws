## Project health

1. What areas and/or subprojects does your group need the most help with?
   Any areas with 2 or fewer OWNERs? (link to more details)

   - Growing additional reviewers and approvers, also see no. 4 below.

2. What metrics/community health stats does your group care about and/or measure?

   - Open untriaged issues and PRs

3. Does your [CONTRIBUTING.md] help **new** contributors engage with your group specifically by pointing
   to activities or programs that provide useful context or allow easy participation?

   - It's up-to-date.

4. If your group has special training, requirements for reviewers/approvers, or processes beyond the general [contributor guide],
   does your [CONTRIBUTING.md] document those to help **existing** contributors grow throughout the [contributor ladder]?

   - Weâ€™re working with SIG-CLI on starting a monthly review club, details to be announced soon.

5. Does the group have contributors from multiple companies/affiliations?

   - [11 companies](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/8/company-statistics-by-repository-group?orgId=1&var-period=y&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=SIG%20Apps&var-repo_name=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes&var-companies=All&from=1609455600000&to=1639350000000) contributed code in 2021.

6. Are there ways end users/companies can contribute that they currently are not?
   If one of those ways is more full time support, what would they work on and why?

   - Increase the test coverage for all controllers.
