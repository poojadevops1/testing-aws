                *   Nov. 15 - KubeCon China, will have meeting
                *   Nov. 22 - if demand outside US, try to have meeting
                *   Nov. 29 - normal meeting
                *   Dec. 6 - 1.13 release retrospective

            *   Please...contrib ex member do your k8s civic duty and volunteer at least once a year in these
        *   [Meet Our Contributors](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/meet-our-contributors.md) - need more volunteers?
            *   Ditto re: office hours above ^^^^
    *   First 30 mins - [project board stand ups](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/1)
        *   KubeCon North America speed networking / mentoring: announcements about to go out.  In coming weeks if we see any mismatch in mentee desired info versus volunteer mentors, we’ll try to voluntell a few community folks who have that info that they should mentor
        *   1:1 mentoring: calendaring is hard, especially between busy people who don’t know each other yet.  Trying to figure out how to keep this basic administrivia low overhead.
*   Open Discussion / Open Mic (put your agenda items here):
    *   Subproject leads reporting next call
    *   Deep dive at KubeCon
    *   Survey bits [paris will be on ~:50)
        *   There’s a huge spreadsheet of data
            *   Mentoring viewed as priority: need help on creating process around the idea of mentoring so that it sticks for people (and is not high adminstrivia overhead)
            *   GitHub management: productivity and workflow friction
            *   Communication platform: notifications, multiple platforms, complexity
        *   What are we missing:
            *   Need to communicate better:  things highlighted in data as needed do actually exist whether in PoC or MVP level, just not known to all yet.
            *   Contributor documentation: people still looking for specific information that’s missing
            *   Deep dives and code tours: have an issue for this now, it’s happening, but people don’t know
        *   Important projects - how do we translate this into our current work?
            *   Roadmap: now and over the next year.  Point people to backlog and ask them to work on it.
        *   Help with this issue? 
        *   Conveying information to developers/community members is still a challenge (both technical and non-technical)
            *   need to distill information down to be more easily consumed
            *   possible weekly newsletter?
                *   [LWKD](http://lwkd.info/)
            *   Information sprawl is still a challenge with information spread across github, slack etc
            *   notification overload is still a problem
            *   Slide template made it easy for sigs to provide their updates, is it worth pursuing providing more templates etc
            *   Do we have things/are there things we have that make specific groups lives easier with regard to information updates?
            *   Possible AI for kubecon contrib summit: get SIG leads etc together to figure out how we can communicate better. 
                *   Encountering scaling issues with general communication as community has grown
            *   Paris looking for help with [communication docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/communication)
            *   AI: reach out to survey people who asked for follow-up contact
            *   Videos etc to cover little bits of the codebase and other tips etc

*   …
*   [k8s-contrib-tools](https://github.com/pivotal-k8s/kubernetes-contrib-tools) vs. [repo-infra](https://github.com/kubernetes/repo-infra) [Hannes & Maria … _if possible let’s discuss that at the second part of the meeting as Maria will join late_ ]
    *   We changed the verify-boilerplate.sh to also allow adding boilerplates
        *   and added some other changes (config file, ….)
    *   We pushed that into [k8s-contrib-tools](https://github.com/pivotal-k8s/kubernetes-contrib-tools)
    *   Only later we found [repo-infra](https://github.com/kubernetes/repo-infra)
    *   Should we merge?
*   discuss.k8s.io [Jorge] - doing well, about 1000 new people since we invited k-users, 777 of them from direct invites
    *   Not planning on sending more emails, we’ll just close k-users list on the 14th.
    *   4 complaints on email invites out of ~7,000 mails sent.
    *   Hoping to connect official CNCF Events into the events subforum tomorrow with Kaitlyn. 
    *   [Contributor Role Board](https://discuss.kubernetes.io/c/contributors/role-board) needs postings! Please mention this exists to SIGs.
*   contributor.k8s.io [Jorge]
    *   Just waiting on design from Alex

    *   Does anyone have a clever workaround? Suggestions?
        *   [jonas] suggestion: Create a small codebase that spits out something incorrect, such as changing the output from Kiubernetes to Blubernetes. Give the attendees sample code that _actually doesn’t pass tests_, and then give them correct sample code that does past tests and corrects the error.
    *   [spiffxp] suggestion: file a kubernetes/org issue (or maybe PR at this time) with list of usernames prior to summit, revert after summit
    *   Anticipate this will be easy to do w/ kubernetes/org automation w/ peribolos by Nov

    *   and then I rambled a bunch about whether we should or not switch
    *   then tim pepper showed up as the release lead and said his piece
    *   I then walked through a demo that roughly compared the tide UI to the submit queue UI
    *   I then agreed to do this again tomorrow, and Tim will put together a proposed cutover timeline, thinking Monday/Tuesday of next week
*   [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1919](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1919) -> dev guide. Needs an owner. Will do an umbrella issue to kick off the structure. (paris)

    *   Turning on automation for all repos under actively managed github orgs [spiffxp]
        *   It’s too noisy for me to talk today, but basically I want to push on the following and am looking for guidance on appropriate amount of notification and lazy consensus seeking for these changes
        *   [label_sync for all actively managed github orgs](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/9054)

        *   _Extra labels won’t be affected. Existing labels get unified w/ happy descriptions_
        *   _Time to start getting the bot(s) out to the other project orgs_
        *   _Big hurdle: Getting the fringe repos with human-merge management converted over._
        *   _Smaller hurdles: One week consensus_
        *   _Larger hurdles: Ehhhh…. Let’s feel that out. Definitely longer._
        *   _Keep ears to the ground, we need feedback to ensure happy adoption_
        *   _Also alerting SIG-Leads. _
    *   @kubernetes/sig-contributor-experience-misc-use-only-as-a-last-resort [spiffxp]
        *   How do we feel about dropping our (contribex’s) other github teams and renaming this? Would we rather wait on a broad all-team-for-all-sigs proposal?
        *   I’d like to do this for sig-testing, and want to understand if I need this SIG’s buy in…
        *   [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2323](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2323)

        *   [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2521](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2521)
        *   _Changing from emailing a list, to creating a GitHub issue_

        *   TODO: “If the results of an election result in greater than 1/3 representation, the lowest vote getters from any particular company will be removed until representation on the committee is less than one-third.” -- Buried in steering, should also be as part of the announcement and voter’s guide?

        *   Aaron expressed doubt about the concept, feels that going to SIG meetings isn’t very scalable.
        *   Jorge mentioned messaging at contributor meeting, but a lot of SIG members don’t attend.
        *   Jorge thinks people are getting the announcements, they’re just ignoring some of them.
        *   This is a temporary/band-aid solution, because people don’t ready emails.

    *   We have a single person bottleneck because the release team disbands post-release, with a single volunteer shepherding patches into semi-regular patch releases.
    *   There’s a lot of reasons and history...how can we get a summary of this into the PR so a submitter of a PR/cherry-pick better understands what the process looks like.  The info that hits the PR today is from the munger.
    *   HELP WANTED: Need a volunteer to move it over to Prow and add more informative text
    *   Cblecker to spiffxp- is there a Target date for mungers to go away? Spiffxp: not sure. Focus on submit queue and cherry pick right now. Just slowly crossing things[ off the list](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/3331).
*   Adding a lifecycle/active label [spiffxp]
    *   Suggesting we replace kubeadm’s “active” label and release team’s “status/in-progress” label with a “lifecycle/active” label
    *   Would like to discuss and get sig-release perspective (since I know some release team members show up here)
    *   Having this part of Prow and /lifecycle can allow non-members to claim an issue.  Today if a non-active issue was left unassigned, it can imply non-active, but only members can be assigned, which is limiting.

*   Elsie Phillips- Red Hat

Agenda: 



*   OSSNA? Anyone interested in putting on a contributor event (live meet our contributors, AMA, test out a concept?)?
    *   Paris, Jonas, Ihor, and perhaps others will be there, will sort out something for a k8s contributor topic
*   Reminder for Paris - update the charter with prototyping time box window (ie - 30 days for first evaluation; 90 days for decision)
*   Anymore centralized communication platform ideas?
    *   moderation:
        *   CNCF to own moderation of mailing lists?
            *   Find out more details here; Taylor from CNCF 
        *   Community management OWNERs to moderate mailing lists?  Dedicated community project-involved moderators seems preferred, with CNCF as an ownership fallback if something needs urgently removed and moderators hadn’t quite gotten it yet.
        *   If k-users is deprecated to discuss.kubernetes.io, that leaves mostly k-dev needing mostly anti-spam.
    *   Owners of any of tools (whether mailing list, GSuite, or other) need to find a way to not loose control of things when users change companies or email addresses.
        *   GSuite documents owned by “team” alias could be better managed?  Paris had looked into it, but bumped into some limitations.  Jonas & Paris to look again.  For most sigs there’s maybe 20-50 active people, but the Thursday community call is where we hit limits as it has a huge list of revolving collaborators.
    *   Open to even wild and crazy ideas: move off mailing lists, off GDocs, etc.
        *   Etherpad?
        *   https://hackmd.io/ 
    *   Calendars are still a pain point
*   Foqal Status
    *   Initial usage seems to be showing value
    *   Vlad’s tracking stats and looking at data quality improvements
    *   
    *  
*   FOSSA meeting set for Friday June 15 @ 2pm PDT [Christoph]
*   Final push for contrib guide - help appreciated
    *   Guin’s going to round up the existing issues, clean and close old ones as appropriate and do new issue(s?) for remaining bits
    *   Which website target?  Jorge knows details on upcoming contributor site
    *   Probably 30-60days out for setting things up on web

Agenda:



*   Recurring items
*   Some feedback from SIG AWS Roadshow I’d like to discuss and get clarification on (Jorge):
    *   help-wanted tag, see [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1959](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1959)
        *   There are issues good for first contribution from novices and issues good first contribution from non-novices.  Discussion in issue 1959 hasn’t resolved to a specific direction.
        *   Could add a role (eg: “issue sherpa”) to the contribx charter to triage help wanted issues for community repo issues.
        *   The issue volume across kubernetes/* repos in the org is large.  SIG leads need to also contribute to this issue triage.
        *   Maybe for discussion by steering:  https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/committee-steering/governance/sig-governance-template-short.md  doesn’t explicitly say anything like “do issue triage and help wanted / good first issue labelling for new sig issues”.  Should it?
    *   Get a better definition for it perhaps?
    *   Specifically a difference between “I need help from anyone who knows this with a few hours” vs. “this would be great for new contributors” 
    *    Subprojects, how to do them?
    *    Guidelines for what is a subproject
    *   We need to put this in our charter, how loose is it? Do we just all lazy consensus and make a subproject?
*   Proposed updates to community demo / hosting guide (Jorge)
    *   Need host to ask demo owners to [review guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/community-meeting.md#demos)
        *   Goal is to avoid irrelevant/too commercial demos
*   PR and Issue queue - should we set up an SLO/A? (paris)
    *   For our k/community queues only
        *   Currently at 90+ PRs and 100+ Issues
    *   Group doesn’t feel like this is an issue - no SLO/A for right now
*   Lgtm, approve, and PR reviews
    *   [Notes from sig-testing breakout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hTw5on7tyVFmTfXIGeXRTA-6ba-ABwDRzzmG3Hu71ak/edit)
    *   [Summary comment](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/7504#issuecomment-380257055) on what /lgtm, /approve, and github reviews do today, and what we want them to do
    *   [Issue that kicked off this discussion](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/6589)
    *   tl;dr violent agreement over /lgtm only applying lgtm, /approve only applying approve
    *   Canary out the lgtm change through community and then other repos
    *   Notify of intent to have common default across kubernetes org repos
*   Ihors proposal about community (Ihor)
    *   [Email link](https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/kubernetes-wg-contribex/CAJRwiqQn_zvVCE5OPUMyE_YwwVG-BJZH6n82wjqEa9XQc0zAsQ%40mail.gmail.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer)
    *   Set up a googlegroups or ask how we can use the k8s domain (aaron will ask steering)
*   Documentation requests (paris)
    *    for sunsetting SIGs/WGs [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2029](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2029)
    *   Moderation guidelines [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2028](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2028)

Mentoring

    *   No control over infrastructure
*   Group mentoring and buddy program, these our ours

        *   IFTTT: could plumb something minimally janky together, but can we do better?
        *   Do academic office hours scheduling tools exist or academic peer study session coordinators?
*   [Meet-Our-Contributors](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/meet-our-contributors.md) meetings

        *   identify individual components and describe how they interact 
        *   point our planned future development, roadmap or milestones for this code 
    *   This is an example for what information would help to have in the code tree: \
[http://alexandrutopliceanu.ro/post/scheduling-in-kubernetes](http://alexandrutopliceanu.ro/post/scheduling-in-kubernetes) This poor soul had to deep dive the code just for the most basic understanding of the scheduler
    *   The linux kernel maintains design and overview documentation in its source tree: \

        *   Dependencies in core in particular that do not have a license or have a license that is incompatible with the K8s apache license
        *   Process for license check is very manual (e.g thockin checks these things)
        *   Important we get this done as the project matures
        *   Scan deps and looks for a whitelisted set of license
        *   Matt farina: this software exists and there is already a SaaS ([FOSSA](https://fossa.io/) - [example embed for readme including issues](https://imgur.com/a/MEei6) - [works on pull requests](https://imgur.com/a/pB8aU) - [works with Go](https://fossa.io/docs/integrating-code/go/))

    *   The revival of for-new-contributors label (or some other wording variety - eg: good first issue (GH standard), etc.)
        *   NEED: to file issue, naming convention for label to include /remove, education around how to use this 
        *   Why: Because help-wanted is producing experienced contributor asks and we need to have something for new folks, regardless of their experience level 
    *   Anyone from testing on the line - anything that we missed?
    *   Wohoo.  We can set the milestone with a new a [prow plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/6982)
        *   /milestone clear
        *   /milestone v1.10

    *   Committing these to github (community in our [sig directory](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-contributor-experience)) Making this more public and discoverable
*   1.11 goals
    *   Write down -- tooling to be able to sync github teams from something committed in the repo [nice to have][cblecker]
        *   Need someone to write a proposal
        *   And a tool to do the sync
        *   Centrally for the whole org or per repo
    *   Tooling for initializing repos consistently [cross team effort with sig-testing]
*   Youtube [jorge]
    *    Ability to add community meetings to youtube
    *   Jorge to document the process	
*   Kubecon Deepdive Intro
    *   Schedule for KubeCon EU available
    *   ContribX Scheduled for 30 min intro session for attendees interested in current state of ContribX
    *   Another 30 minutes for deep dive -- interact with community in WG setting and pick a few problems and tackle it
    *   Get feedback from existing contributors
    *   Qs?
*   Getting feedback on and rolling out process changes [spiffxp]
    *   I’m at helm summit so likely not around to give my 2c on this, so I commented on the opt-out issue that started this discussion in sig-testing
    *   Opting out of commenter jobs that auto-/close and auto-/lifecycle inactive issues
        *   [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/6903](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/6903)
        *   Wait to hear back from spiffxp@ and discussion at Helm summit
        *   Possible that we turn this off temporarily until we have discussion with helm.
    *   Automatically requesting reviews instead of assigning
        *   Was silently rolled out a while back, have there been any impacts?
        *   [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-dev/_9DOG0DPmlE](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-dev/_9DOG0DPmlE) 
        *   [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/4179](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/4179)
    *    /lgtm, /approve, and the principle of least surprise
        *   Have we gotten consensus on making things explicit? WDYT the next step should be here?
        *   [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-dev/PJJxV9roXI8](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-dev/PJJxV9roXI8) 
        *   [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/6589](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/6589) 
    *   How does Testing and ContribX communicate effectively?
        *   When design proposals come out, that would be a broad enough net 
        *   Don’t want to throw every proposal out to K8s dev and wait for feedback -- take forever and still not be conclusive
    *   Consistent experience while also accommodating different needs per sig/repo
    *   Lazy consensus doesn’t always works
        *   One objection can stall entirely proposal
    *   Community meeting is a good place for visibility
    *   Something like KEP but for K8s ContribX/Testing Process Improvements
        *   Make proposals more formal
        *   Also make them on a regular cadence.  Rolling things out monthly or biweekly
    *   Need a way to present decision making process to people that are effective
        *   Right now there are docs, issues, keps etc
        *   Consistency
    *   Communication Channel
        *   Using ContribX as the forum for giving feedback
        *   Maybe(?) a separate mailing list of process change announcements -- low volume communication channel for changes proposed to contributor workflow
    *   Should every repo have a contributing.md
        *   Show the differences between this repo and core K8s automation and tooling (e.g implicit self-approve is not enabled here)
        *   A lot of them point back to contributor guide in community
    *   Owner(s): 
*   Documenting labels [spiffxp]
    *   I’m at helm summit so likely not around to present this, but please let me know if I’m on the right path here. I shared this with grod yesterday and I gather it made the rounds at f2f.  Specifically interested in feedback on what information is missing, what the final output format should look like, and how it should be updated.

Any new contributors or new to Contributor Experience? Please introduce yourself! We are happy to help.



*   /lgtm discussion - docs, testing
    *   Do we need/want conformity across repos?
    *   Does or should lgtm mean approve?  Current automation does implement lgtm as an approved and will now merge marker
    *   Is clarity and least surprise in the process more important than requiring existing workflows to change toward a common workflow?
    *   What is the code review process? (contrib guide is adding info, but approval/merge criteria is not documented)

    *   Open issues:
        *   Moderation: steering committee considering splitting.  This should remain tied to slack admin’s.
        *   Tighten distinction between contribx owning curating cross-k8s policy and procedures, with sig-testing owning the mechanisms of implementing policies
*   [Roadshow](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jn0ZOaWX5h5HYhbUP74mcBw9d-sQ2ARm0UFGcInD08Y/edit?usp=sharing):
    *   quarterly contribx visit to each SIG to take messages to them and get feedback
    *   There’s a core set of things that need periodic messaging, eg: KubeCon deep dive sessions, mentoring and SIG membership growth
    *   There will be periodic topics in need of engagement driven, eg: the /lgtm vs /approve topic
*   Determine priorities for DevStats feature requests [jberkus, lukasz]

Agenda:

Any new contributors or new to Contributor Experience? Please introduce yourself! We are happy to help.



*   Product Owner for DevStats
    *   Role: What do the charts mean?  What’s missing?  What do sigs care about?  Charts from different perspectives?  How healthy is my sig?  How healthy is the overall community?  SLO’s (service level objective \
...out metrics for ourselves in sig contribx)?
    *   We have an excellent engineer will to extend devstats.  But he needs guidance on relevant metrics
*   New labels [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bl965KDJb8xrVmf3o90aRQdwZZ9XU9g0lLkwmA8M1YQ/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bl965KDJb8xrVmf3o90aRQdwZZ9XU9g0lLkwmA8M1YQ/edit) (Sahdev and Garrett) 
    *   Provide feedback please!
    *   Take to broader community - k/dev; helm and other subprojects
    *   Any objections? 
        *   Grod - might not need more bot commands. Need rationale for closing. Might modify the current command? Four new labels added - add more modify existing labels on devstats; modify the close command.
        *   Cblecker - solicit feedback from helm
        *   Labels are for all the repositories under kubernetes org, not necessarily every repos have to use them but adding new label may clutter some repos not wanting to use these labels  
*   Bare metal developer kit - Jose (intel), Jorge (heptio)
    *   Jose to follow up with Jaice Singer DuMars
    *   Jose and Jorge to follow up with Lukas from Cluster Lifecycle

    *   Would this be useful? Need feedback.
    *   If you’ve seen blog posts from people about home set ups of k8s, please pass those to Jorge.(slack; jorge at heptio dot com)
    *   Grod - have you talked to [lucas](https://luxaslabs.com/) from cluster lifecycle? Wants to make k8s accessible to students - could be a good approach
*   Meet Our Contributors! \o/
