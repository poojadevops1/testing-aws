    * APAC coordinator update [who dis?]:
* Devstats [Lauri]
    * I've summarised the OSPM persona for DevStats, and that's with Jorge and a few others for review.
    * [@Nikitha Suryadevara](https://kubernetes.slack.com/team/U0138V70E4V) and [@Sergey Kanzhelev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/team/U013U7PFRA5) have stayed in touch on the weekly progress report template -- they've gotten some feedback from SIG Chairs and TLs and posted it at the bottom of [their planning/roadmapping doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JOXKBDgXmQzz8YQSYa7XYcfVteM79iMtvId1aQXC1e8/edit). IMO the next step would be to define some goals -- for example, I think inspiring X number of SIGs to try out the reporting template.

            * Not ideal for our workflows
            * Joel - waiting rooms aren’t as bad as you think they are, done meetings with 100s
            * “I would say the best practice is to have at least two hosts/co-hosts so a person without much speaking responsibility can manage the waiting room.” ← we are supposed to be doing this already
            * Joel says there’s a popup saying that people are in the waiting room. 
        * AKA, we need to update all of our meetings. @#$@#$
        * Everyone will have to monitor the waiting rooms. 
        * [FAQ Meetings Waiting Room and Passcode Requirements, September 27, 2020 – Zoom Help Center](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360045009111-FAQ-Meetings-Waiting-Room-and-Passcode-Requirements-September-27-2020)
        * Current lazy concensus as of this meeting, move to a single passcode workflow for all our meetings, yolo. It’s not like we use passcodes for security anyway. 
            * Our SIGs have assigned hosts anyway, and it beats babysitting a waiting room.
        * Things we need to update:
            * sigs.yaml links, make it a global variable so when zoom makes us change this. 
                * SIG READMEs once you generate
            * SIG chairs need to update all of their meetings in zoom with their account.
            * All SIGs need to update their notes to point to the right URL
            * We need to update all the calendar entries for every single meeting. 
            * Slack topics and pinned docs (probably)
            * All the usual major change criteria
                * K-dev
                * Mention at community meeting

    * CNCF is happy to sponsor the Orbit ([https://orbit.love/](https://orbit.love/)) implementation for Kubernetes (ChrisA has presented this project briefly at the SIG-ContribX meeting on July 29th - see the notes below)
        * Ihor had a brief chat with Orbit team - they are happy to make a deep dive presentation of the tool for ContribX

* Open Mic/Discussion
    * [nikhita] Changes to approval plugin
        * [root OWNERS for k/k](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/93637) 
        * The current approval plugin does not allow us to structure approvers in the way that we want to.
        * Current code base is...messy (there be dragons) - needs to be completely rewritten.
        * Root approvers don’t want to sign off on a PR because anyone with an LGTM could cause it to merge without further review. They will wait till sign off from all other approvers before putting their approve as it comes with so much access.
        * Approval plugin rewrite KEP
            * Feature: Approve JUST specific directories or files
                * Root approvers can approve anything
                * No way to currently approve specific things without approving the entire PR
            * Feature: Be able to approve specific things at the root only (go.mod)
                * Individual approval for files
                * Go has issues with following symlinks, cannot be put in a subdirectory with its own set of owners.
            * Feature: Track root / granular approval for devstats
        * Next steps:
            * Schedule meeting for design discussion [nikhita/lauri]
                * This will be a template to focus the “product,” pulled from available resources and tweaked for our situation
                * Nikhita can use that to collect feedback from the group who brought this topic and cement the plan [other people with thockin] 
                * Invite folks to provide feedback
                * Solicit contributions from not-overcommitted folks

        * To be successful with this guide, a user needs to employ some documentation about Docker within the Kubernetes proper documentation (SIG Docs domain) that currently references the superseded docker-machine ([https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/c94242a7b1d238cc27aea9b6d45ccb9963e814bb/build/README.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/c94242a7b1d238cc27aea9b6d45ccb9963e814bb/build/README.md)).

            Joel misspoke during the meeting and claimed it was documentation owned by Docker, but it is in fact Kubernetes documentation.

            * Backstory: The meeting used to be on Friday night, which was bad for EMEA, it was split into an EMEA-friendly and an APAC-friendly.
            * Monday meeting is redundant and doesn’t work for those currently involved.
            * Tuesday also is an inconvenient time for those currently involved.

        * Will remove 150~ people, 40~ owners.
        * Add a path for previous members to come back to the org with less requirements.
            * If they show themselves as active… fastrack
            * Via a PR… adding handle back to list
            * ?? Do we need fasttrack, the bar is pretty low as is, simplify vs adding more steps ??
        * AI: Email will be sent out
            * Will the emails be sent directly to the contributors / org-member?
                * No, it’s going to the list
            * We don’t have a mapping from person to SIG

        * SIG-Release has a 24 deadline for Agenda Items
        * Cancelling or Merging meetings that aren’t well attended
        * IF Weekly, standup is biweekly, project owners biweekly
            * To reduce burnout
        * If stuff is in the agenda, we might not have to cover it fully
    * [Paris/Bob] SIG/WG quarterly updates haven’t been occurring outside of the ones for each monthly community meeting.
        * Should we schedule SIGs/WG to update and roll their decks into the meeting notes for the monthly meeting before sending it out?
        * Ask them to PR a link to their update into their README?
        * Looking for other ideas to ensure governance requirements.
        * Only 3 SIGs sent an email to k-dev, meeting reduction may have contributed to visibility
            * Some kind of document that collected updates on a monthly basis
