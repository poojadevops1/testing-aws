    * Speed Mentoring at Kubecon
        * The session at Kubecon was well-attended
        * Had 8-9 kubernetes people as mentors
        * Was it people looking where to get started?  Some, but there were also people looking to advance.
        * Definitely should participate in again
        * TAG-CS is talking about doing a prep session for mentees before the speed mentoring.
        * Madhav was on the community table, there was a lot of experience sharing, people talked about their own contributor experience.  Madhav shared contact info, shared where to contribute.  This worked out well.
        * Better than usual follow-through from mentees.
    * CNCF Mentoring
        * Overhauling CNCF mentoring repo to make it accessible to mentees

        * No updates
        * [Laura] No community meeting this month (KubeCon), November community meeting is week before US Thanksgiving
        * [Josh] We have the label, do a campaign to use the label. (Laura still has to do a blog post) For the November community meeting, suggest to find a volunteer(s) to do a summary of decisions at Contributor Summit (Summit recap)
        * [Bob] If hosts are needed, we have ContribEx lead shadows that can volunteer — after KubeCon
    * Contributor Summit(s)
        * Will see everyone at the summit
    * Other/Discussion: 
* Mentoring:
    * Meet Our Contributors [Paris]
        * This is archived unless the office hours folks stop bringing on contributors 
        * [Josh] Move to more or less the same as APAC is doing, doing Meet Our Contributors as blog posts. This will be easier to maintain. The last few Meet Our Contributors sessions were not well attended. Video is a huge effort versus a stream of blog posts
    * Future priorities: 1:1 hour, group mentoring
* Community-management:
    * YouTube Automation Updates [nigel]
        * Trying to get zapier to behave: first send to drive, then send to youtube
        * Should videos automatically go live or not?
            * Josh: eventually they should but let's see the results before we do that
            * Nigel: concerns about video hijacking
            * Initial version will not go live automatically
        * Limitations: we can make 5 zaps and have 100 actions run
            * We'll get a paid account if we need it
            * Pre-authorize a paid account?  CNCF already authorizes it, we just need to file a servicedesk ticket
        * If we get this working, do a CNCF blog so that other projects can copy it
* Marketing [Kaslin]
    *  Comms is all about Kubecon
    * Contributor survey next year?
* Contributor-documentation:
    * Contributor Guide [Bob]
        * [Noah] Want to evangelize non-code meetings that will come together post kubecon
        * Course is not going to publish before Kubecon – will pub after
        * Craig working on live demo using minikube & codespaces, would like to have configurations in k/k github dir
            * will switch from minikube to kind
            * will create issue and tag Bob etc.

        * Has already been shared publicly in Sched

        * Active comms campaign - hoping for more submissions
    * Other/Discussion: 
* Mentoring:
    * CNCF mentoring working group underway – coordinate?
        * CNCF has the same concerns and challenges: same set of internship programs (e.g. outreachy and GSoC, GSoD, LFX)
        * Want to recruit coordinators for each program
            * Already have one for outreachy
            * A coordinator: act as an admin for the program (larger time commitment during the operation of the program), keep track of deadlines, get listed with each program
            * Current issue is when contribex does it there are too many conflicting independent deadlines
            * Debabrata and Paris had documented this role, [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/programs/mentoring-lead.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/programs/mentoring-lead.md) but it didn’t work as desired. If we get commitment and early. Will draft comms and get it sent out next week
            * Leverage excitement around KubeCon to get the message out
    * Group mentoring at KubeCon - is it happening? Who from CNCF is running it? Is there a signup sheet? Wendy West @ CNCF usually handles it
        * Participate in some way - Noah is going to reach out

            * Slackbot ownership
    * Find us in #sig-contribex-comms!
    * Josh
        * Succession plans included in the role definitions - roles are time intensive and give shadowing a meaningful
        * Renames: Comms Tech Lead, Event Comms Lead to distinguish from other roles
        * Need similar definitions for contibex roles - linked from the charter (not on the charter so sigs.yaml doesn’t require rebuild)

        * Demo
        * Omer can provide access to those in the k8s org - anyone who can edit the md in the issues can create task lists
        * Note: K8x merges are not managed by the GitHub permissions
        * Omer is looking for a point of contact - for feedback and a shared slack channel - #github-management is the right slack channel
        * Madhav suggests sharing the info and the gist in #github-management channel
        * Doesn’t yet work for PRs (e.g. a list of issues a PR closes) but will in the future
    * Discussion/Update:
        * [madhav][update] Prow now has support for closing issues as “Not Supported” and the bot auto-closes issues as “Not Planned” now. Ex: [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/109661](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/109661)

            * [Bob] Definitely will need to communicate the change to the broader community and also ask for feedback since this essentially changes the triage process for dev on k/k.
                * People used needs-information as an indicator of “we are not accepting this work until more information is posted”
                * Before rolling this out, we would need to have community consensus on this.
                * Good item for community meeting
        * Completes triage automation
        * Need to message out the change

        * What if it disappears (e.g., Katacoda)?
            * There’s options like GitPod, but that would require running servers.
        * How do we describe the difference between Katacoda and Codespaces?

    * [your name and topic here - should this be an issue against kubernetes/community?]
    * Craig - ideas about using GitHub Codespaces to smooth the onramp for new contributors, and for maintainers to review PRs. Other ideas around mentoring?
        * Hasn't heard back from anyone yet
        * Craig joined github codespaces in April, trying to help OSS projects get the most out of it
            * Not everyone has access yet
        * Codespaces is a custom dev container which runs vscode (backed by a whole vm with tools, debugger, testing etc)
        * Would like to offer new contributor experience for builds
        * Can do live PR builds/reviews in the codespace
        * Not available to all users yet, could make it available to all kubernetes org members though
        * Better to be accessible to folks who are not yet org members – maybe create kubernetes-learners and turn on for that group
        * Some brainstorming about ideas on how to use this
        * Craig (pairing with Marky) will identify the personas and use cases, and look for volunteers via [https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev) 
    * Marky - Add a new section for public moderation status?
        * Yeah, let's overhaul the template

        * Cancelled this month's meeting as the planned topic for the steering charter PR (ref last Contribex meeting) is out of public review by that point. No need to poke at it more, and getting topics together this quickly won't happen.
            * At this point steering has the input it needs to merge the change.
            * [Bob] We also wanted to keep all the discussion in one place, instead of keeping it scattered across multiple avenues.
        * Need to cancel the meeting invite if someone who has perms can do that (please and thank you!!!)
            * [Bob] Done
        * [Help Wanted] As usual, please notify Laura or someone from contribex for items to be discussed in the community meeting.
    * Contributor Summit(s)
        * NA kicked off, lead roles are filled -[ looking for shadows](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/6734)

            * [Bob] we are now looking for shadows for those roles - to be leads in future summits.
            * [Bob] Doesn’t cover everything but covers quite a few things related to events: [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/events-team](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/events-team)

        * [Josh] Going to propose a few changes to the process of publishing blogs.

        * [madhav] Auto-close issues as “Not Planned”: [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/26380](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/26380) 
            * Wanted to put it on the agenda to generate some discussion around this on the issue.
            * Context: GH API recently added a new state for issues to be closed with reason “Not Planned”
            * Helpful to close duplicate, support, stale issues as not planned.
            * Currently the default reason/state for auto-closed issues is “Completed”.
            * [Bob] I dont think “Not Planned” will need to go through community wide consensus, the messaging if changed, will need to.
                * +1 to this either way.
            * [Josh] This will need an announcement rather than feedback.
            * [Josh] Will need to announce on #kubernetes-contributors and dev mailing list.
        * [Bob] New Member Coordinator selection
            * Should be notified soon, waiting to hear back from all github admins

    * [mahamed] Hi, I’m working on this PR for sig-release [https://github.com/kubernetes/org/pull/3451](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/pull/3451) . Details [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/pull/3451/files#diff-77d2ef584aad105b3c74e744d7b7a497e54e6d7c026acc629e075acde8f98984) and [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/2175). Would be nice to get this feature approved so I can move forward with this.
        * [Bob] Don’t believe this belongs in the k-org repo. This should be moved to the release repo. If it’s in the k-org repo, it would become the responsibility of the admins, and it’s a workflow that is specific to release.
    * Finalize Josh as Chair? Done
    * [Kaslin] Forgot to mention - Buffer!
        * [Need get a budget request approved](https://github.com/kubernetes/funding/issues/32)

        * Canceled this month due to KubeCon
        * Should most likely cancel the October community meeting because a contributor summit will be happening very close to it.
            * Should check in closer to the date
    * Contributor Summit(s) []
        * ~110 registrations
            * About double what we had in LA.
        * 12 sigs signed up for meet and greet
        * 4 sig meetings at summit
        * Things should be busy!
        * Planning for Detroit has begun
            * Room layout already selected. 1 more room than we have for EU. 1 big, 4 small rooms.
            * No new contributor workshop, but workshops targeting active org members (intermediate level) should occur in Detroit.
            * We should designate someone to be in charge of contributor awards sooner rather than later.
    * Steering Election:
        * Josh not planning to be on the committee this year.
        * Need to launch the subproject after KubeCon
            * Stuff needs to be moved from the community repo, which is likely to break electo (our automated tool)
            * CNCF wants to use this process for some of their own elections, so it needs to be packaged up nicely.
            * Got a lot of election documentation to update/backfill. May need help.
    * Other/Discussion: 
* Community-management:
    * SIG-Cluster-Lifecycle’s mailing list has reached the point where they are too big to be able to work properly. Will need to convert it as we did k-dev.
    * We want to get everything over to k8s.io managed groups over time.
    * Expect this to be rolled out over the next year.
    * We can now do shared drives with custom domains, which is nice.
    * The transparency report makes it look like there’s a lot more CoC sanctioning stuff going on than there is. Nowhere do we explain that the slack admin team mainly just kicks spammers off the slack.
        * This gave one person the impression that the CoC committee was having a sanctioning meeting once a week, which is far from the truth of what that group does.
        * This could use some clarification.
        * Also people get warnings before they get kicked out.
            * Marky was gonna write up a lot of this
* Marketing [Chris/Debabrata/Kaslin]
    * 
    * 
    * PR out to change our repo name in github
        * Marketing Team -> Contributor Comms
    * Buffer request was on the Steering committee meeting agenda
        * **ASAP **Need to open a PR to the steering funding directory. Once there’s a thing to +1, it’ll happen.
            * Chris is on it.
* GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    * Discussion/Update:
        * Nikhita forwarded a schedule which needs to be set up. To look into again post-KubeCon.
        * [Josh] Quality of life improvement suggestion: would be great to have a tool to communicate to other leads, when a lead will be out.
            * GitHub admins will be giving ops-genie (atlassian on-call tool) a spin for this.
* Open Mic/Discussion
    * [PJ] Two SRC + SIG Security proposals:
        * SECURITY_CONTACTS merges with OWNERS. Any suggestions on how we could achieve consensus on this? Also, thinking of using this tool: [https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/maintainers](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/maintainers) to keep the new field fresh. With whom and where should we start this collaboration?
            * Bob made a similar suggestion a while ago. Will need signoff from: 
                * github admins
                * prow/sig-test
                * general consensus from community via k-dev.
            * We have a huge issue with keeping reviewers and approvers accurately recorded in OWNERS files. Some automation could be useful here.
                * If you need to do it, talk to sig lead or look at approvers and look for most active ones.
                * There is some action going on here for automation to at least remove inactive approvers.
                * There are thousands of owners files. You might want to limit it to named subprojects.
                * Possible to keep the security_contacts field empty.
        * New mailing list per SIG for private triage that includes SIG Chairs (SIG-foo-leads maybe can be reused?). Extra responsibility for the chair. How can we do a pulse check?
            * Export control considerations here. Generally in favor of looping in sig leads to find the right people for these types of needs.
            * If we’re going to do this, is there some way we can warn the SIG leads?
                * [Josh] Suggestion: Propose an unconference session at the contributor summit. Many of the folks who need to be involved in this discussion will be there.
                * Also a good item for next month’s leads meeting. Only chairs and TL’s are normally invited, but we can get it on the agenda and add Pushkar as needed.

        * Great work on the community meeting last week!
        * Still have an open issue/PR in progress ([https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/6544](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/6544) and [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/6597](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/6597))
    * Contributor Summit(s) [Alison]
        * Planning ongoing
        * Currently looking at ~80 registered attendees, not sure what actual will be.
        * Working on sorting out space for SIG Meetings
        * SIG Meet & Greet also in the works.
        * A lot of messaging needed right now, Chris and Kaslin on that.
        * Could really use a coordinator for the SIG Meet and Greet
            * Event will occur on the Friday of KubeCon, during lunch.
            * Most of the work is needed now. You could do this role even without attending.

* Community-management:
    * No updates
* Marketing [Chris/Debabrata/Kaslin]
    * A lot of comms needed right now for the contrib summit
    * Also need some comms for SIG Meet & Greet
    * KubeCon EU tweet spreadsheet is all together, and coming along. Tweets getting spec’d out in the sheet.
    * Working on creating a new GitHub group to get tagged in issues
    * Keeping an eye on release comms because reasons
    * [Question] Calendar?
        * Short version: Kinda; it’s not in place yet but we want it. Working on a lot of things to get back to fixing up some things like the Twitter bot.
        * We do need to have an events calendar. This may be a role for the contrib comms sub-project.
    * Improved twitter bot might be a great mentoring/internship project
        * Ask CNCF to pay for [Buffer](https://buffer.com/pricing)?  About $150 a year.
            * Social media scheduling tool. Could function as a central hub for social media comms (not email). Can also produce a calendar, which could be useful.
                * Even has approval tooling.
            * [$5/mo for individual account, $10/mo for a team account.](https://buffer.com/pricing)
                * Josh: We should go ahead and request the $10/mo account.
                * Funding request needs to go through Steering Committee; Josh will ask Bob
                    * [https://github.com/kubernetes/funding](https://github.com/kubernetes/funding)
            * Laura: There’s other ones like Sendible and Hootsuite, but I agree Buffer is probably better for this group
                * Josh: Hootsuite is around $1000/year
        * We’ve had folks interested in this work, but have lacked mentors for this project. Don’t have folks familiar enough with the twitter bot and/or with time to mentor. Which is why this might be better as an internship. Someone more experienced could just get paid to do it for a bit.
* Contributor-documentation:
    * Contributor Guide [Bob]

        * [Josh] Social events scheduled, unconference format, 
            * Nigel Brown is content lead
            * Relatively low-key
            * Registration is higher than LA currently at 60. 
            * Starting next week, soliciting attendees for other things like thinking about topics, scheduling SIG meetings. 
            * Please share that registration is open
            * SIG Docs is planning for a docs sprint
            * Happy to have volunteers to help
        * [Bob] Hotels are being booked for Detroit

        * [Josh] SIG Meet and Greet will be during one of the lunch periods
        * [Bob] Second leads meeting is tomorrow and we can mention it and add it to email to leads list
    * Other/Discussion: 
* Mentoring:
    * Meet Our Contributors [Paris]
    * [Paris] Still looking for 1 person to help out with group mentoring. Group mentoring for roles like owner/approver. Focus this year on growing more owners. Will link an issue on the chat. 
    * [Paris] Meet Our Contributors still on hold and will be bundled with Office Hours which will be handed over to CNCF
    * [Josh] Will try next week to try async meetings for mentoring group. We did a poll on meeting times and the results were not helpful. 
    * [Bob] Is the meeting officially gone from the calendar? Bob will check
* Community-management:
    * [Paris] YouTube needs automation, it’s a higher priority thing. Some SIG leads like to update their own videos but most others don’t. Affects the transparency of the project. Get the word out, get help. 
        * [Laura] Building automation for PulumiTV. Will talk to David and take care of both at the same time. Using CUELang and Pulumi (maybe - we’ll see)
        * [Bob] Let’s create a service desk ticket and get this done
* Marketing [Chris/Debabrata/Kaslin]
    * Discussion/Update
    * [Kaslin] Kaslin is taking over marketing and comms for Contributor Summit Valencia.
    * [Bob] Tweet that v1.24 is delayed - PR is merging
    * [Josh] A few surveys ongoing: Release cadence survey is still going. Taylor is helping to reach the right people for the survey about renaming k/k master branch to main. Reached out to the usual channels, CNCF conformance, vendors.
    * [Kaslin] We can do another tweet on k/k branch renaming
    * [Bob] Get the distribution list from Security Response Committee
    * [Paris] From Zoom chat, [Security-discuss@kubernetes.io](mailto:Security-discuss@kubernetes.io)
    * Discussion/Update
    * 1.24 release delay
    * 1.25 release team applications
    * Release cadence survey still going
    * Contributor Summit
    * Master->Main branch rename
        * Target audience; Groups that do a build from git, to update their ci/cd to be ready
        * Poking the security response committee to see who actually builds
* Contributor-documentation:
    * Contributor Guide [Bob]
    * Developer Guide [Erik/Joel]
        * [Erik] PR is on the way, and working on to the next phase on the e-learning module
        * [Bob] Only thing left on the PR is fixing markdown links
        * [Erik] Errors came from using Google Docs
        * [Bob] Google Docs has markdown support
    * Contributor Site [Bob]
        * [Bob] No other updates besides info on the contributor summit. Another potential contractor thing is to rewrite the converter (bash script) and moving contributor guide to contributor site
* GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    * Discussion/Update:
        * [Bob] Nabarun and Arnaud are new GH admins. Still will look for back-filling on new member coordinator role to process the applications. Nabarun is working on automation on removing or adding people.
        * [Madhav] On the status of automation, we found that it can be fully automated. Is it time to introduce a new label that communicates help-wanted. Everything has an interpretation of it
        * [Bob] Gut-take is that it would not be used, we get complaints of too many labels
        * [Madhav] We have good-first-issue and help-wanted, are these 2 labels enough. We have a guide on the labels
        * [Bob] It’s the SIG’s interpretation, there’s an expectation that whoever takes that help can do it with little guidance. Maybe update the messaging to be more explicit with what most SIGs believe what “help-wanted” will be used for. Another idea is another survey on what folks think “help-wanted” means
        * [Josh] We have too many surveys going on, put this new survey after 1.24. What if we get incoherent signal. 
        * [Bob] A lot of the SIGs use help-wanted if the regulars don’t have capacity but issues need to be worked on. 
        * [Josh] Could also mean lack of expertise like if an issue needs a cryptography expert.
        * [Madhav] Maybe updating the wording to be clearer
        * [Paris] From Zoom chat: Add this as another question for the larger contribex survey that should come out in summer
        * [Paris] From Zoom chat: IMO/E - good-first-issue (its easy as heck and/or you have a mentor), help-wanted (we need help and what we can help you with is in the issue)
* Open Mic/Discussion
    * Release Team Shadow Application - Diversity [Joseph]
        * [Joseph] There are areas where we can improve
            * Gender ratios:
                * Shadow applications 105 - 21
                * Shadows 13-12
                * Team leads 5-1
                * Lead shadows 3-1
            * Also have challenge with representation maybe work on async meetings better
            * How do we amplify and get more diverse applicants. We don’t ask much besides pronouns. Are there areas where we can train leads e.g. inclusive speaker training. For 1.25, 4 (maybe 5) of the leads identify as women.
            * [Paris] Please comment here [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5913](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5913)
        * [Josh] Is an advocate from bringing back video interviews
        * [Laura] It’s hard for women in tech space to attend meetings. Reach out to companies like get past leads to encourage companies to push for this. There needs to be education on the employer side
    * [Rey] Release Team shadow reports from this [Slack thread](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C1TU9EB9S/p1649839127329499) \
[https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/release-team-shadow-stats/issues/7](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/release-team-shadow-stats/issues/7) 
    * [Josh] Would like to get approval on Deb’s for 3rd party mentoring handbook \

        * Paris was on today showing love for contribex! 
        * [Paris] David and Carlos, Carlos will host office hours as well, are looking to take the program to CNCF and not contribex for sustainability reasons. It’s not official yet until we migrate the documentation over. Once we can migrate documentation in regards to operations of office hours then it will be a CNCF thing. Trying to figure out where that lives in the CNCF.
    * [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adztrJ05mQ_cjatYSnvyiy85KjuI6-GuXsRsP-T2R3k/edit#gid=932627810) [Laura]
        * [Laura] Starting this month, meeting invite is out. Nigel will be our host. Nigel has an email out to k-dev which is now via form. Three major topics: dockershim removal, reliability, updates on 1.24 and a brief we moved k-dev. There is a form where people can propose a topic and when they would like to present it. Trying to figure out how to get form to contribex Google drive.
        * [Paris] Can we create a form in GitHub or maybe an issue template. We can do a drive and set Laura up as an editor. 
        * [AI - Laura] Laura to add [contributor@kubernetes.io](mailto:contributor@kubernetes.io) as editor on the form that is already created
        * [Rey] Can we do announcements, asking for the March community meeting
            * [Laura] Yes
        * [Nigel] Agenda should be up-to-date, will do a dry run and watch a previous meeting
        * [Laura] Will also be on for the recording, call for a note taker
        * [Nigel] Open question is what goes in the blog - for post-call

* Mentoring:
    * Meet Our Contributors [Paris] \
	- LETS GOOOOOOO
        * Lets make April our new launch 
        * Or should we bundle this into office hours and not do it? 
        * [Paris] Since calendar is unjammed now, we should kick off Meet Our Contributors. Want to talk about sustainability of the program, since its an intense gathering and preparation. It’s great for new contributors who want to help out. It takes about 5 hours to do one monthly episode. In the Office Hours, there’s a new format that includes a contributor on what they’re working on so there’s a meet a contributor vibe there. Should we continue to do Meet Our Contributors or wrap it with Office Hours so it’s something that we don’t have to maintain. 
        * [Deba] We started a meeting our contributors blog series with APAC region 
        * [Paris] Maybe keep meet our contributors as a blog
        * [Paris] Will open an issue and make final decisions on the issue. If we don’t join meet our contributors with Office Hours then maybe do a Meet Our Contributors to once a quarter instead of once a month
    * Playground, gsoc, outreachy, LFX Mentorship Program [Ihor]
        * [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/6471](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/6471)
        * [Paris] Do we need a third-party coordinator to manage full-lifecycle (not just outreach) LFX, GSOC, GSOD. Right now, we do it ad hoc. Should we make this more formal as a SIG for this role.
        * [Deba] SIGs were not getting the dates, we have an umbrella issue to reach out to SIGs and use slack bots to inform of deadlines.
        * [Paris] Thinking of more of full lifecycle management beyond outreach. Include managing interns as well
    * [New Contributor Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XiXjDWCc087VKqX2b6LMGRnlaRyLYGh2-eWQQr6dAmc/edit#heading=h.vs8waxtx792q) [Alison]
    * KubeCon tickets for contributors [eddiezane]
        * [Eddie] We as SIG Leads and chairs, we should have a way to get KubeCon tickets for active contributors. Who should we talk to? 
        * [Chris Short] Chris can help
        * [Alison] This should be brought up with steering and reach out to CNCF and will reach out to other contribex leads
        * [Paris] This is in progress
        * [Eddie] Doesn’t need to be a full scholarship (transportation and housing) just a ticket
        * [Paris] Need a process for this and work with the CNCF, there’s an open issue to follow [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3783](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3783) 
* Community-management:
    * [Nigel] On youtube, AI to create an umbrella issue and conducting testing
* Marketing [Kaslin/Chris/Debabrata]
    * Discussion/Update
        * [Chris] Tweet for tomorrow’s community meeting, release team support, SIG profiles
        * [Deba] Working on talking with release team emeritus advisors on how can shadows contribute if they’re not selected
* Contributor-documentation:
    * Contributor Guide [Bob]
        * [Erik Arneson] Created a Google doc with changes they want to make, a Google doc was a poor choice to diff with markdown - almost done. Working on restructuring of help wanted guide to drive new and existing contributors to path that would be most helpful
    * Developer Guide [Erik/Joel]
        * [Erik] Looked at the developer guide and it hasn’t changed a whole lot since the last time Erik and Joel worked on it a year or 1.5 years ago. There’s a stale issue for SIG leads to work on their developers guide.
    * Contributor Site [Bob]
        * [Paris] need more contributors
* GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    * Discussion/Update:
        * [Paris] need more trusted contributors
* Open Mic/Discussion
    * [your name and topic here - should this be an issue against kubernetes/community?]
    * Annual reports are going on
        * If you are a subproject owner ,check in with your chair to update them on whats up 
        * Summary will hopefully be published at the end of March and will need the outreach horns - marketing team already knows 
    * [Carlos] Went to kubernetes.dev, where to start?
        * [Paris] https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site
        * [Erik] The path on the site doesn’t match the path in the repo
        * [Carlos] Want to update the office hours links
        * [Paris] It’s canonical to the source, PR to the source then it will update kubernetes.dev
        * [Carlos] Can help to get the preview link working for kubernetes.dev 
    * [Carlos] Carlos runs a Kubernetes book club, uses personal invite for calendar invite and is hitting the limit. Can this be part of contribex to have a Google group and run the invitation via the group
        * [Chris] Out of scope if its vendor inclusive and books have to be accessible to everyone
        * [Paris] From chat, scope of this sig is upstream
        * [Carlos] not vendor specific, we pick free books like Production Kubernetes, 197 things SREs need to know
        * [Paris] CNCF is the perfect home for this
        * [Paris] See if the CNCF Ambassadors want to help out, at least you can get a mailing list with the CNCF
        * [Kaslin] There’s a book club in the CNCF slack

    * Contributor Summit(s) []
        * No updates right now
        * Will be a copy-paste of KubeCon NA right now (small rooms with rounds, etc.)
    * Other/Discussion: 
        * No new questions
* Mentoring:
    * Meet Our Contributors [Paris]
        * Should this stay on here? Yes.
        * Paris is doing roadmap planning for mentoring with help from mentees.
        * New MOC once we’ve had 1-2 community meetings (so dependent on that as community meetings are higher priority right now)
        * So plan is for Q2 relaunch
        * Question:
            * How to help with roadmap planning? Paris doesn’t have anything specific right now. Going through issues and PRs that have an “area/mentoring” tag, on spreadsheet with impact and timetable, then deciding what goes into what quarter. Looking to get that approved by subproject owners after organizing the issues.
    * Playground, gsoc, outreachy, LFX Mentorship Program [Ihor]
        * Outreachy: Paris would like to start an outreachy request for Rob Scott (Gateway API). Start up a lot of support in that area.
    * Group mentoring: Paris wants to prioritize this in 2022. Issues will be incoming to reboot group mentoring.
        * Need to set up a programmatic setup so “you don’t need a Paris to set it up”
        * [Chris] Docs? [Paris] in the repo
        * It’s impactful and visible. We grew 10 chairs from this initiative last year. We need to do this.
    * [Paris] No one has really figured out the 1:1 program, so either should sunset or get someone back onboard.
        * [Bob, Chris] in favor of sunsetting. Hard to get investment.
        * [Paris] Will make the issue to sunset it.
    * [New Contributor Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XiXjDWCc087VKqX2b6LMGRnlaRyLYGh2-eWQQr6dAmc/edit#heading=h.vs8waxtx792q) [Alison]
        * Joel, Eric, and folks from Lion’s Way will be tackling this.
        * Probably starting up in later Q1/early Q2.
            * [Paris] Will be perfect timing for Meet Our Contributors, maybe try to collaborate with that
* Community-management:
    * YouTube [Nigel]
        * Making some progress. Working on the automation for YT. Need to figure out what’s captured in issues in the repo presently, so then can address programmatically vs addressing only pain points. Working on Zoom and such in terms of capabilities. So triage time!
        * [Bob] The rest of CNCF and all will find this hugely helpful, so great job! [Chris] +1
    * No other questions
* Marketing [Kaslin/Chris]
    * Discussion/Update:
        * Twitter automation fixed :tada:
        * Need more folks interested in writing/interviewing SIG leads for SIG Spotlights
            * Stalled out after the new year. Send folks to the marketing meeting if you know anyone!
            * Purneswar Prasad is willing to help. Will come to the meeting.
        * APAC blog went live this month (last Thursday we think because time has no meaning right now).
        * Other blogs in progress; should it go to the dev site first? We’re discussing it.
            * [Bob] We’re currently dual-posting to both. Canonical URL would boost the SEO for k-dev, so that’s why it would be good to put it to the dev site first. Please do :)
    * Question:
        * How are we planning comms for Dockershim?
            * So much work going on for this. There’s a whole Slack channel on this. Celeste is leading this effort, and it seems to be going well *knock on wood*
            * Other than the work out of docs, don’t want to stir the hornet’s nest/bring up a ton. So blogs that come from that are good; more than that might not be the best.
            * [Paris/Bob] Suggestion: Focus on the upstream contributor for marketing. Contributor site blog on that audience. Call to action on contributors. Stay scoped. Link to project board. A “meta” call.
                * Docs are focused on the downstream user.
        * Annual reports are starting to kick up; no specific thing for marketing right now, but what about what to do _after_ annual report is done? Tweets, blog posts, etc. Paris will come to the next meeting to start digging. End Q1/beginning Q2.
            * [Debabrata] Need an efficient way to do this. Last time it was a doc; would really appreciate a better way.
* Contributor-documentation:
    * Things in flight that need review:
        * [Style updates to contributor guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/6347)
        * [Comms updates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v8U1jqSduLwm7lzNPILm2vmuGFy8hUPL) (large overhaul of at least 3 comms docs)
    * Please try to make some time for these two reviews over the next couple days.
* GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    * EasyCLA slated for flip over on 5 Feb 2022 (it’s a Saturday)
        * Could use social boosting and Slack boost (dear Marketing…)
        * [Josh] Currently, reporting path is via LF ticket. But it gives us no idea of how many problems exist.
            * [Bob] Was the same problem as before, though. That’s why we let it soak for 2 months with the old one. We’ve searched for consistent issues right now, and it seems like it’s mostly new contributors that signed the old CLA and the database sync hasn’t happened. It’s a small number. So we should be mostly set at this point. (Bob’s been talking with LF about this a lot.) Things should be pretty good by now.
    * Test Infra PR: [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/24844](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/24844)
        * ^^ Open PR for flipping to EasyCLA.
        * [Madhav] Key difference: We have removed our bot’s message on every CLA-no. Message from the LF bot now includes those details automatically. No need to duplicate notifications.
    * [Madhav] k/k issues right now are mostly along the lines of support vs bugs or feature requests. Also there’s quite a few bugs/requests that are opened against versions no longer supported.
        * There have been discussions (and an issue opened) around how to handle support issues. Different SIGs do different things (some ignore, some attempt to answer). The triage bot also close issues actively if it’s support with rotten and all, which is a negative experience.
        * Instead of letting the triage bot auto-close, what if we had a “kind/support” label? The bot then responds with “hey, this is a support request, it will be closed in 30 days, but here’s where you can get support.” (to avoid the rotten message). ← Update the lifecycle plugin.
        * Feedback:
            * [Josh] Why leave them open for 30 days?
            * [Madhav] To provide as much support as possible, but set expectation that there’s no guarantee of support.
            * [Bob] SIGs don’t all triage the same, either. A lot of the time, there are things left open. Alternative messaging other than “rotten” would be helpful.
    * [Madhav] Same logic but for out-of-support versions
        * Triage label for “out of support” that has the same 30 day period and the bot tells them with a link to the version policy, etc. Will need to consider who can apply the label.
        * Feedback:
            * [Bob] Would this require bumping each time?
            * [Josh] No, think the tag is stateless.
            * [Madhav] Only org members or someone specific could apply that label.
            * [Bob] Oh, so not automatically applied.
            * [Josh] Would definitely need to have a human check if it appears in current/supported version.
            * [Madhav] Based on current activity, it’s a really common question on whether it’s reproducible on a current version
            * [Bob] What about updating the template with a link to the version docs.
            * [Bob] Advanced tags and such don’t typically get used as much outside of a core group. So we’d need to socialize this a lot if we change/implement a solution.
    * Answer to both: Yes, create an issue and ask for feedback!
        * Note that we would have to apply this *just* to k/k. (And the support request in k/k takes you right to discuss.k).
    * [Josh] New tag with “release notes action required” to alert people for changes before upgrading. Release team thought that would also have the release notes tag, but not always. They’ve fixed that, but are there any other tools that use it?
        * [Bob] The rel notes website (​​https://relnotes.k8s.io/). But looks fixed.
        * We haven’t announced that tag; probably should notify k-dev.
* Open Mic/Discussion
    * [Nigel] Event coming up in Austin - Open Source Summit. Do we do stuff with that?
        * [Paris] A great CFP is the Zoom to YouTube integration :D
        * Really, fill out the CFPs for this kind of thing for the contributor stuff.
        * In general, we don’t do anything at that event.
    * [Josh] Maintainer submissions due on the 14th. Will we submit?
        * [Bob] Yes… ? Any other subprojects that want to do one? Will ask in Slack.

* Welcome and recurring business  [Host]
    * CoC [Host]
    * New Contributor Intro here \o/ [Everyone]
* New Year Kickoff [Alison]
    * We’re here!
    * 2021, Briefly
    * 2022, What’s in store this Q
* Events:
    * Office hours [Rawkode]
        * [Bob] There’s talk of making it part of Cloud Native TV instead of a Kubernetes event
    * [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adztrJ05mQ_cjatYSnvyiy85KjuI6-GuXsRsP-T2R3k/edit#gid=932627810) [Laura]
        * Sorry, can’t make it in person. Update is now that the kdev migration is done, we can start the meeting back up again. Question: **Would it be better to let people get settled for January into the new mailing list before sending out a meeting invite?** (so plan for February to start back up)? Thoughts welcome! - Laura
        * Bob & Chris : Yes
        * Chris - What is the new mailing list
            * Bob - We migrated from googlegroups to kubernetes.dev
            * public mailing list was too large to send cal invites to everyone
    * Contributor Summit(s) [Bob]
        * Do we need to start planning for Valencia now [Alison]
            * [Alison] AI - PR into the repo a new folder for Contributor Summit 2022 Valencia
            * [Josh] Do we want to plan any formal Contributor Summit if this KubeCon will be up in the air like the recent KubeCons
            * [Alison] We can plan out and have a potential redundancy plan for virtual.
            * [Bob] We put the room reservation in already, for the same type of space as NA - 1 room with rounds and 1 smaller meeting room and SIG Docs will have a room. Assumption is that it will be a repeat, we haven’t submitted any A/V requests yet.
            * [Alison] Should give a space for EU contributors to catch up
        * Contributor Celebration tl;dr retro
            * [Bob] Virtual, no longer worth the investment (less attendance)
            * [Bob] Awards can still be virtual but prefer to be in-person
            * [Alison] Still have value in events like the bake-off 
                * Had to cancel the bake-off this year to low participation
            * [Alison] Having a roadmap kind of thing would be great & helpful
    * Other/Discussion: 
* Mentoring:
    * Meet Our Contributors [Paris]
        * [Paris] Now we have a dev list we can kick-off Meet Our Contributors but it’s lower priority than the Community Meeting. In the project state, we need maintainers and retaining the maintainers instead of new contributors. Would like to put a sem-hold for Meet our Contributors.
        * [Chris] What does the Contributor Meeting need?
        * [Paris] We need a program manager to drive it for structure, interesting topics, etc.
        * [Bob] Laura’s structuring idea would work well but we didn’t have calendar invites. Things like bigger cross-cutting KEPs and inter-SIG things would be interesting for maintainers
        * [Paris] Think about this with sustainability in mind instead of a monthly event
        * [Alison] Possibly have Meet our Contributors in Cloud Native TV?
    * Playground, gsoc, outreachy, LFX Mentorship Program [Ihor]
        * [Josh] gsoc is not open for applications yet but it will be open soon, not sure what is going on with LFX cycle
        * [Bob] Around LFX and outreach, instead of having to re-create proposals have SIGs massage/re-submit for the next scheduled thing
        * [Josh] We have a directory under community to get the various SIG leads to fill things out
    * [New Contributor Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XiXjDWCc087VKqX2b6LMGRnlaRyLYGh2-eWQQr6dAmc/edit#heading=h.vs8waxtx792q) [Alison]
        * [Bob] Tech Writers will be starting soon both on updating the contributor guide (re-doing it from scratch, give it 1 style / 1 voice) and that will feed into the workshop that will be developed
* Community-management:
    * [Need to Know Chairs/TLs email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC799hHZpo8JJfwvUa94uiPfUpo17oTTJDFobxNLL7c/edit) [Bob/Alison]
        * [Alison] A little behind, for chairs/TLs, if you have things you would like to share.
        * [Paris] Don’t think we do this anymore
        * [Bob] We send to the leads list
        * [Alison] We’ll remove this
        * [Paris] Background, chairs and TL still need forms of communication and things need to bubble up to them. A lot of the chairs thought we were giving a lot of info a lot of the time. Since now we have the monthly meeting and we have a leads list, we don’t need this anymore.
        * [Bob] +1 to that
        * [Alison] Agree to this and will update on the agenda template
* Devstats [Bob]
    * [Paris] We should remove this from the template also
    * [Josh] Should come off the regular template
    * [Bob] Dims wrote a tool to update devstats in shared repos better
* Marketing [Kaslin/Chris]
    * Discussion/Update
    * [Chris] Twitter automation is still broken, still need to look at it. A couple of Meet our Contributor posts in-flight below:
    * [Deba]-Meet our Contributor series(Blog Post)
        * [https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/31208](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/31208)
        * [https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/pull/279](https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/pull/279)
    * [Atharva] Default for the automation is the master branch, when Atharva changed it to main on his local then it worked
    * [Chris] Do we need a GitHub admin to help change the master branch to main
    * [Bob] Don’t need a GitHub admin, there is a doc in k8s.dev/rename to help
* Contributor-documentation:
    * Contributor Guide [Bob]
        * [Bob] No further updates other than tech writers starting on contributor guide
    * Developer Guide [Erik/Joel]
        * [Bob] Lump this with the Contributor Guide. Erik, Joel, and one additional person are tech writers
    * Contributor Site [Bob]
        * [Chris] SEO, trying to improve k8s.dev in search results
        * [Alison] Just tried searching Kubernetes Contributor on google and k8s.dev came up first
* GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    * Discussion/Update:
        * EasyCLA
            * Hard Cutoff Mid february, Need to check that issues are resolved
* Slack-infra [Jeefy]:
    * Discussion/Update
    * [Bob] Suggest to scratch this from the agenda
* Open Mic/Discussion
    * Hello from the K8s 1.24 release team [James/Xander]
        * If you have been involved, continue to be transparent
        * Improve the contributor experience for release team
    * Blog - I didn’t make it on the Release Team, how can I still be involved?
        * Find a team which is still looking for new contributors
    * Roadmap
        * [Alison] Would like to have a session on developing a roadmap
        * [Bob] Need to look at priorities and milestones
        * [Alison] Aspirational goal, by end of next week, it would be nice to get the tidying up done.

        * [Bob] Will do the bakeoff and art (Josh to organize)
        * [Rey] Rey, Cody, Mars, Purneswar are working on the awards
        * [Josh] Starting an artist group for Kubernetes, new Slack channel called [‘Krafternetes’](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C02LM67B3GA), this gives us a pool of people to sign up for things like designing an awards plaque
        * [Bob] Last year, took till June to send out awards and Canada was the hardest. May use KubeCon Valencia to distribute awards
        * [Paris] DevOps party games will contribute
        * [Bob] Jack Box games allows you to do personal questions
        * [Bob] Meeting invite for Celebration went out on Monday and we’ll use that as the main touchpoint
    * Steering Election:
        * [Josh] Steering election is over. Retro is still being scheduled. Probably next Thursday then will share it with Steering. One thing that came out is a technical to-do list that should be fixed in the platform
        * [Bob] Dawn wrote a script that will scrape GitHubs and commits to get the emails of the voters
        * [Josh] Link to the election retro \

        * [Josh] Need to define roles
    * Other/Discussion: 
* Mentoring:
    * Meet Our Contributors [Paris]
        * Blocked on kdev migration - same as community meeting 
            * https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5877
        * [Bob] Need to have a k-dev admin to create this
        * [Paris] Will start on this today
        * [Josh] Biggest thing is to change permissions on the documents. Need to blast out to all the SIGs
        * [Paris] Will get a timeline on an issue: first tell the leads for a heads up about the docs, then an email to k-dev, then continue on
        * [Bob] Do this after the 1.23 release (Dec 7)
    * Playground, gsoc, outreachy, LFX Mentorship Program [Ihor]
    * [New Contributor Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XiXjDWCc087VKqX2b6LMGRnlaRyLYGh2-eWQQr6dAmc/edit#heading=h.vs8waxtx792q) [Alison]
        * [Bob] The contract is done for hiring the tech writers, PO is cut. Hopefully content will be produced soon and updating the Contributor Guide. We can engage more directly when the PO is done
* Community-management:
    * [Bob] YouTube Admin responsibilities
        * [Paris] Has 4 mentees ready to go , but have not heard from current admins about roadmap (Chris is a YT admin and can help). Need to share the load more and think of the automation. 
            * [Bob] Even if we solve importing of videos, need to publish with correct date and correct name for each of those and that takes the longest
            * [Chris] Agrees that it is the longest process of updating and uploading to YT
            * [Bob] All SIG leads need to make sure all meetings are named correctly
            * [Josh] Can we quickly automate uploads (with wrong name and categorization) - yes from Paris. Then have folks rename and categorize videos after
            * [Paris] Still have a pipeline issue (using Splain, third-party exporter) and a human issue 
            * [Paris] Need an ok from the admins to onboard mentees - yes from Chris and Bob
            * [Paris] It’s a trusted role, have to be cautious with deletions since they’re permanent 
            * [Bob] Some sensitive things can be uploaded so we state that it’ll be at least 24 hours until a video is uploaded for videos to be sanitized
            * [Chris] We need more folks for marketing
                * [Kaslin] We have a good number of folks, but need clear shadowing roles/processes
            * [Paris] Broadcast to k-dev
            * [Josh] Bring it up to the mentoring session, there are a lot of mentees wanting an opportunity
            * [Chris] Marketing meeting is on Fridays at 11am Eastern
        * Need to get a meeting with all admins - only mentees responded to the doodle

        * Discussion yet to be finished
        * Still coming up with KubeCon NA
        * We’ll punt to next year so we can focus on the mailing list migration.
        * Do we have a discussion about the whole mailing list migration agenda?

                    To be added below.

    * Contributor Summit(s) [Bob]
        * We need to archive the contributor summit website
            * Will be a pretty good GFI(good-first-issue) - Eg: MD links addition
            * Ex. PR - [https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/pull/196](https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/pull/196)

            * Emailing all the sig mailing lists 
            * A sort of video or something to advertise steering elections
            * Since there are a lot of companies that have employees as contributors to k8s, can we send out mail through them? - It’s already done (Eg: Redhat, Google, Vmware)
            * The election email address can apparently send out emails; some work needs to be done to set that up to reach SIG mailing lists without getting a ton of notifications
            * 
        * Other/Discussion: 
            * APAC coordinator meeting - that meeting has been canceled for a while; there was a coordinated sprint for a different APAC initiative (the blog, I think), but that sprint has finished

        * Tech writers are working on it
* Community-management:
    * K8s dev migration
    * Contributor documentation - rotated around lifecycle periods - SIG Docs is refusing to redirect contributor docs because of the need for localization (translation to other languages)
        * The contributor site does support localization, just no one has done it yet.
        * Need someone to start working on that localization
            * [https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/issues/167](https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/issues/167)

    * Laura Santamaria
    * Kim Schlesinger
    * Madhav Jivrajani
    * Arnaud Meukam
    * Josh Berkus
    * Bob Killen
    * Ihor Dvoretskyi
    * Alison Dowdney
    * Kim Schlesigner
* Welcome and recurring business  [Host]
    * CoC [Host]
    * New Contributor Intro here \o/ [Everyone]
* Events:
    * Office hours [POP/Rawkode]
        * Seems to be going well?
    * [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adztrJ05mQ_cjatYSnvyiy85KjuI6-GuXsRsP-T2R3k/edit#gid=932627810) [Laura]
        * August is going to be the release retro
        * There was another discussion about whether the community meeting is worth persisting with the current model. Do we want to discuss that here?
            * Biggest problem is updating people’s calendars
            * We can export k-dev now! So should make a managed account easier to avoid the API limits :) We’re working on that. Comms is now the big thing. We need to define a plan for cutover. Laura will talk with comms to figure that plan out.
    * Contributor Summit(s) [Bob]
        * Going well!
        * Reg form is live. Comms and Website updates are incoming
        * Original plan/idea is still being followed.
        * Next big decision: Where to host social
        * Separate meeting on Mondays (you will get the invite if you’re on the contribex mailing list--join to get it added, or ask in the Slack channel)
        * SIG meet and greet spaces are available on Wednesday at some point.
    * Steering Election [Josh]
        * SC Elections: need EC members (first step)
            * Normally 3-person election committee, all from different employers
            * Josh: tech implementation
                * Using Electo
            * ??: Voter management
                * Maintaining list
            * ??: Comms
                * Sending out messages
                * Will reach out to the marketing team and ask (note can’t be Broberg or Short because they work at the same company as Josh)
            * If you’re interested in joining the committee, let Josh and Bob know
    * Other/Discussion: 
        * N/A
* Mentoring:
    * Meet Our Contributors [Paris]
        * Now have Streamyard :tada:
        * Still need calendars to get figured out, like with the community meeting
    * Playground, gsoc, outreachy, LFX Mentorship Program [Ihor]
        * Kicking off the fall cycle soon (LFX mentoring)
            * [https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/tree/main/lfx-mentorship/2021/03-Fall](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/tree/main/lfx-mentorship/2021/03-Fall)
            * Dates are Sept 1 to end of Nov
            * Call for Projects going out soon
        * No updates for GSOC. End of program is end of August. 17 mentees this round.
            * Last year was ~18-19
    * [New Contributor Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XiXjDWCc087VKqX2b6LMGRnlaRyLYGh2-eWQQr6dAmc/edit#heading=h.vs8waxtx792q) Course [Alison]
        * Good chat about everything on Monday
        * Potentially getting tech writers from budget from Google (yay help!)
        * Still need to set up page layout, then need to translate current stuff to guide format (currently in talks and slides format)
        * There are a bunch of open issues in GitHub (prefix: NCW2). Jump on in! Mentoring meeting is on the SIG Contribex calendar.
        * This upcoming Summit in North America isn’t running a New Contributor Workshop, as a side note (and likely won’t do one at KubeCon again due to low usefulness/amount of people actually sticking around. Seems to be better with local Meetups).
        * As a replacement, see SIG Meet & Greet above in the contributor summit section.
* Community-management:
    * [Need to Know Chairs/TLs email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC799hHZpo8JJfwvUa94uiPfUpo17oTTJDFobxNLL7c/edit) [Bob/Alison]
        * Several things on the docket:
            * Contributor Summit stuff
            * Steering election reminder
            * General discussion around making tech leads mandatory along with terms and term limits
            * K-dev migration! Send it to *everything*
                * We need to set a timeframe. Set it to after the steering election? But calendar issues are acute right now.
                * If we do it now, we would need to start comms right now and do the cutover in August
                * We’d do a straight cutover. And we can remove bouncing emails, thankfully.
                * Elections wouldn’t be too affected *other than* permissions on Google Docs.
                * Moderation queues would be a big deal to get started. Every single new person posting would need to be approved, which would be everyone on a new Google Group.
                * Need a minimum of 5-6 people
                * We’d also need to block posting to that list at some point to help move over to the new list.
                * Biggest thing is coordinating the comms. We’re migrating, and k-dev will be first.
                * We can create the list now and start moving over docs and all while still in the initial comms phase.
                * How about migrating sig-contribex first? Or having a starting list to move to catch things...
                * Note that this migration is the Google Workspace Automation issue on GitHub
                * We also can do it for any list; the person who exports the list has to have admin access to the list.
                * Offer: k8s-infra as a guinea pig. Especially since the working group is becoming a SIG.
                * TODO: Recruit Team
                * TODO: Draft comms
                * TODO: Test with k8s-infra/contribex
                * TODO: Consolidate to one GitHub issue
* Devstats [Lauri]
    * No updates
* Marketing [Matt/Kaslin]
    * Discussion/Update
    * Quite a bit of work coming up!
    * Lots of asks moved over to the marketing agenda (thanks, Kaslin!)
    * Couple of articles in progress (SIG-Node and Contributor Summit)
    * Comms for registration and contributor summit stuff
    * Bart Farrell is doing great work with a video series from contributors
    * If you need help, ping the group at contributor-comms on Slack, join the meetings, or ping Kaslin!
* Contributor-documentation:
    * Contributor Guide [Bob]
        * No updates
    * Developer Guide [Erik/Joel]
        * No updates
    * Contributor Site [Bob]
        * No updates
* GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    * EasyCLA Migration
        * Biggest thing. We still want to try for next week, but the PR to add the support to the CI is still open. Has not been tested yet. A lot of back and forth going on.
            * [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/22742](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/22742) (as soon as that merges, test so we can get it going :) )
            * Aaron is watching it
            * Theoretically, seamless migration.
            * Will loop in comms when we’re ready to launch
    * Recently, there are a lot of good first issues, but a lot of people aren’t giving enough context to make them good first issues. So a lot of people who pick up an issue are stuck and need help. Madhav has been trying to help and pinging authors for context. Has there been any discussion to have better prompts or otherwise encourage better context on the good-first-issue labels (versus just tagging it and not having enough context)?
        * Not really yet, but good question.
        * Anyone can tag. Probably would be good to send a reminder out.
        * Probably no better way to do it than the one at a time situation, unfortunately. The original author or someone with strong knowledge of the code needs to do it.
        * If you do it, feel free to note that you’re doing it on behalf of SIG Contributor Experience. And feel free to add the context if you already know. Be sure to ping on GitHub and Slack both.
        * What about a good-first-issue template? Checklists and everything. Might be hard to create across all of the repos, but yes
        * Note that a lot of issues start out as regular issues and then get flagged later.
        * A comment from a bot would probably help.
        * Contributor comms would be helpful here, too :) Kaslin added to the marketing agenda
* Slack-infra [Jeefy]:
    * Discussion/Update
        * Huddles are awful. The end.
        * Josh disabled a bunch and is working through them all.
* Open Mic/Discussion
    * [arnaud] domain validation for Search Console.
        * Last year, we were talking about this. Did we do this, or is it still needed?
        * Project was to improve the SEO of the .io website.
        * Arnaud has access to the console now (yay)
        * ~Probably need to reach out to docs~
        * We actually mean the shortcut links, so ignore some of the above comments. We’re talking about k8s.io
        * There is a problem here since we use so many short links
        * We can add text records in the management stuff.
        * Arnaud’s got this :) No big rush, though.

## June 30th Slack Meeting



* Mentoring
    * NCW at KCD Bangalore had over 75 attendees and 50+ people submitted their first PRs in contributor-playground!
    * Still need to get streamyard licensed for MoC
* Events
    * Community Meeting
        * Still hunting for July's host; call is out on Slack in #sig-contribex and #kubernetes-contributors (looking for another engaged host for the first handful of events, which is why this isn't an email out to k-dev just yet).
            * Paris volunteered as backup
        * Calendars are still a sore point
        * Some tentative topics are on the docket already for July
        * Still evaluating the format as our attendance has been low in comparison; as a reminder/note, we're thinking a lot of the problem is Zoom fatigue more than the format not working
    * Summit planning kicking off soon separately from main meeting
* Community Management
    * Kick off meeting with 1password scheduled, will begin plan of rollout soon
* GitHub Management
    * [Retain LGTM through squash](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/22663)
    * [EasyCLA Migration](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/2778)
        * LF has been provided a dump of org members and anyone that has opened a PR within the past year to validate cla status
        * [WIP PR adding support for the different CLA context to the prow plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/22742)
        * Assuming both the groups and plugin can be done and tested, current target time frame is the week of August 9th
* Slack Infra
    * Slack Moderator Plugin went into CrashLoopBackOff
        * K8s infra working on monitoring solution


## June 23rd Meeting



* Host: Alison/Bob
* Notetaker: Laura
* Attendees: 
    * Kendall Nelson (diablo_rojo)
    * Laura Santamaria
    * Kaslin Fields
    * Alison Dowdney
    * Josh Berkus
    * Ihor Dvoretskyi

    * Arsh Sharma
* Welcome and recurring business  [Host]
    * CoC [Host]
    * New Contributor Intro here \o/ [Everyone]
* Events:
    * Office hours [Jorge]
        * No updates? See notes on streaming
    * [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adztrJ05mQ_cjatYSnvyiy85KjuI6-GuXsRsP-T2R3k/edit#gid=932627810) [Laura]
        * Updates to guide, website, etc (open PRs)
        * Concern about a lot of work put on the hosts again. How can we get away from the requirement of the hosts needing to be majorly plugged in?
        * Also, count? ~30 people on the call. Publicity blitz didn't really get the turnout we'd like to see. There were no good discussions or questions.
        * Has the new format experiment failed?
            * Hard to get people to come when it's optional right now, also hard with calendar invite not being able to go out.
            * It probably will be a full year before the Zoom burnout ends.
            * Let's start with the calendar invite problem? We've basically lost the constant communication channel and people live by their calendars.
            * We really need to migrate k-dev to a managed kubernetes.io address… This is a lot of work to do.
                * KEP?
                * Might be a great first issue set for updating docs and such across the project. Hackday! The Google docs will possibly be the hardest part.
                * TODO: Create an issue and start talking about all of the things that need to happen for this migration.
    * Contributor Summit(s) [Bob/Deb]
        * Graphics finalization
            * Survey Monkey. Support request was sent in because the survey results were by number that didn't match the image… We're still waiting to hear back from SM Support (Ihor)
            * Clear winner is #2, but we don't know what 2 is. Deb will vote and we can see which one incremented by one.
        * Timeline for registration to launch?
            * We should start scheduling a meeting and have a team together to plan.
            * Recruit the full team :D
            * Then Doodle for a date. Guess probably is end of July/early August.
            * Then we can start programming
        * Reception search
            * Deb's working on venue search now
        * Video of space at venue will be coming in a month or so.
        * Result from online v in-person. 20% (24) in-person no matter restrictions; 26% (32) if company restrictions lifted, 18% (22) in person if international ok. 28% (34) virtually. 2% (3) don't plan to attend.
            * Guess: ~200. Think ⅔ of folks we're used to.
            * Google has explicitly allowed KubeCon
            * RH individual exception requests
            * Little startups mainly are as you feel comfortable
        * If these numbers flip because of variants or something, we're already planning for hybrid, so *should* be an easy switch for content. The things that will change are food/beverage, giveaways, etc.
    * Steering Election [Josh]
        * Get Electo properly packaged for Kubernetes infrastructure.
            * Could host on Equinix Metal cluster…
            * Go to test infra team? WG-k8s-infra?
            * There's a lot of options
            * Managed Google MySQL instance
                * This is ~$75/mo
        * Election in September
        * Announcements not quite yet. Later part of July.
        * Will pull list of contributors from devstats
        * Community repo is where election stuff will keep living
    * Other/Discussion: 
        * Streaming platform (Streamyard)
            * Update to double-check the login. Once it's paid for, we're good to go.
            * Can someone log in without creating an account? Can we pass credentials off to fill out finance data as an example?
                * They'll send an email with a passcode. You can pass that to someone else to login.
                * Currently set up to the [stream-team@kubernetes.io](mailto:stream-team@kubernetes.io) address
                * TODO: Ihor will get back to the group on this
* Mentoring:
    * Meet Our Contributors [Paris]
        * Semi-blocked on Streamyard and calendar issues (see community meeting)
        * July clashes with US holiday
    * Playground, gsoc, outreachy, LFX Mentorship Program [Ihor]
        * No major updatesl next milestone in a couple weeks
        * GSOC is in progress, as is LFX Mentoring
    * [New Contributor Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XiXjDWCc087VKqX2b6LMGRnlaRyLYGh2-eWQQr6dAmc/edit#heading=h.vs8waxtx792q) [Alison]
        * Tidied up the PR and all. Next to update the website PR to remove contributing folder
* Community-management:
    * [Need to Know Chairs/TLs email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC799hHZpo8JJfwvUa94uiPfUpo17oTTJDFobxNLL7c/edit) [Bob/Alison]
    * The potential k-dev migration and the planning involved!
        * We want to test switching with contribex. Probably step 1.
    * Coming up, lots of various small stuff for all of the SIGs (fallout from the annual reports)
        * We will probably get pinged to help with solving the YouTube uploads, getting meetings scheduled, etc. etc.
        * Not now, but soon.
    * Community survey [Josh]
        * Josh putting graphs together.
        * Anyone really want to poke around in the data and look for things? Ping Josh.
        * TODO: Export raw data into csv for the contribex raw results collection
        * TODO: PII-scrubbed version to get merged to k/community
* Devstats [Lauri]
    * There will be ability to filter by SIG and WG labels (issue link)
* Marketing [Matt/Kaslin]
    * A few requests coming in through Slack; good to work with the community meeting.
    * Talking about process, limitations, etc.
    * How to enable more people is a big conversation, so keep an eye out for that getting shared
    * Savita from the release team joined after hearing about marketing in the community meeting, and that communication channel is a big win!
* Contributor-documentation:
    * Contributor Guide [Bob]
        * No updates
    * Developer Guide [Erik/Joel]
        * No updates
    * Contributor Site [Bob]
        * No updates
        * Two open working things
            * WIP preview of listing the enhancements on the page ([https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/pull/222](https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/pull/222))
            * Arsh - Ingestion stuff
                * Currently can specify in YAML the repo URL and files to copy over. Still stuck on links.
                * Detecting the links in the files is part of the current line of work.
                * Next steps for the content ingestion script [@arsh]
                    * Bash script uses regexes; no issues currently because we haven't imported content that has links in code blocks.
                    * Next step should be looking for libraries that can pass links in markdown. Laura will hunt.
                    * Goal: Search for links and then get them all corrected, then drop them in the correct location in the repo.
* GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    * Upcoming: Issue in k/org - EasyCLA migration. Original timeframe was after code freeze, but right now, too little time to communicate and test. Now probably headed to the backup date. In short, in the works, but moving back.
* Slack-infra [Bob/Josh]:
    * No updates
* Open Mic/Discussion
    * [your name and topic here - should this be an issue against kubernetes/community?]


## June 9th Meeting



* Host: Alison
* Notetaker: Laura
* Attendees: 
    * Alison Dowdney
    * Laura Santamaria
    * Arsh Sharma
    * Eddie Zaneski
    * Sahdev Zala
    * Josh Berkus
    * Sheetal Joshi
    * Deb Giles
    * Bob Killen
    * Kendall Nelson
    * Cody Crudgington
* Welcome and recurring business  [Host]
    * CoC [Host]
    * New Contributor Intro here \o/ [Everyone]
* Open Mic/Discussion
    * Script to ingest external content into the contributor site [#93](https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/issues/93), [Slack thread](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C1TU9EB9S/p1622097259050400) [@arsh]
        * Context: Current contrib site uses a lot of regex to find and fix links from a bunch of extra repos and sources. We want to replace the regex.
        * Current plan: First clone the repos and then rename to drop the directories and all to just have the .md info.
* Where are the rules for renaming the file coming from? Is there anything to keep in mind?
    * Outside of renaming the files, once you get to updating the links, then you have to do the fuzzy replace of the directory location to where it will exist in Hugo (on the contributor site)
    * The logs are the data to follow to help understand it.
* For now is it fine if we follow this structure -> clone, rename, replace links
    * Yep! Sounds about right. Review happening in a 1:1
* How would I know the URLs to be used for the links?
    * This is where the regexes come in, to look for links in the markdown docs. We want to get away from that to use the markdown library to do that (since regex picks up links in codeblocks that we don't want to change - e.g., links to a repo)
    * Bob will resync with Arsh after he has a moment to go back through the code.
    * [your name and topic here - should this be an issue against kubernetes/community?]
* Events:
    * Office hours [POP]
        * It is still set to go, that's what we know :)
    * [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adztrJ05mQ_cjatYSnvyiy85KjuI6-GuXsRsP-T2R3k/edit#gid=932627810) [Laura]

        * Josh volunteered to host June; happily will take more people signing up for other months!
        * Eddie's KEP!
            * [https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2777](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2777)
        * TODO - Ping contributor comms to ping all the slack channels (and add that to the hosting guide)
    * Contributor Summit(s) [Bob/Deb]
        * Don't forget the poll! Update: 99 people responded so far. Everyone wants something in person; 21 attend no matter what, 28 people if company travel lifted, 19 people attend if international, 26 virtual, 3 not planning on doing so. Only 15 people responded to the late-add question. Generally, people want to attend in person, and some will attend virtual if needed.
        * Registration released sometime in the next week or two.
        * Helpful: save the date. Can we get that up?
            * Yes, but put it on the contributor site to keep everything together.
            * Graphic options are available (for branding). The contrib site doesn't exactly have a theme, but happy to put up a banner! Watch Slack for options. LA theme
                * Put it to a vote at the community meeting! Deb will connect with Josh.
            * Hotel: JW Marriott
            * TODO: All details to get dropped in Slack so the site can get updated
        * Next: When should we do this? Day -1, Day 0?
            * Guess what, the colo events will happen both Monday and Tuesday :uh-oh:
            * Monday is probably our best bet still (Day -1)
            * Picking Monday, will disperse on Tuesday.
            * Will want to look into social activities for Monday night.
            * Maybe need rooms on Tuesday for a SIG to say they want a bit of time to meet
        * Maintainer track CFP still TBD
        * Planning for now will still be part of this meeting until we eventually need to meet separately.
    * Other/Discussion: 
        * N/A
* Mentoring:
    * Meet Our Contributors [Alison]
        * Didn’t go ahead; event was missing on calendar and other issues like rescheduling the mentoring meeting so it doesn't conflict with MOC. 
        * Need to sort out streamer for this or streamyard (aka who can host July?)
            * At this point, for streamyard, we're going to get there. Bob's looking up how to make this happen for a shared account. (Also working on 1Password - the OSS version)
        * Issue for July: First Monday is July 5, which is problematic for US folks.
            * Need to explore the right day/time for July being different.
    * Playground, gsoc, outreachy, LFX Mentorship Program [Ihor]
        * N/A
    * [New Contributor Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XiXjDWCc087VKqX2b6LMGRnlaRyLYGh2-eWQQr6dAmc/edit#heading=h.vs8waxtx792q) [Alison]
        * Updated the PR that was in motion :tada: Should be all squared away soon. Please review the PR if you're able/supposed to.
        * Aiming to get all the bootstrap stuff done by end of the week
        * Goal: Get Done by KubeCon NA, so October
* Community-management:
    * [Need to Know Chairs/TLs email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC799hHZpo8JJfwvUa94uiPfUpo17oTTJDFobxNLL7c/edit) [Bob/Alison]
        * Drop an item in there if you need to
* Devstats [Lauri]
    * Updated to support individual repos/SIGs stats!
    * Pick dashboards we want to offer in a curated fashion to SIG/Subproject leads to embed in the contrib site (with interpretation info)
* Marketing [Matt/Kaslin]
    * Discussion/Update
        * Soon, there will be the ability to request tweets by opening an issue (which will do all the automation for the PR for you)
        * Note that it will not support image embeds as that's a limitation of the tool. Ping contrib-comms manually still for those
* Contributor-documentation:
    * Contributor Guide [Bob]
        * No updates
    * Developer Guide [Erik/Joel]
        * No updates
    * Contributor Site [Bob]
        * No updates
* GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    * Discussion/Update:
        * The big thing is the migration to EasyCLA (to replace current CLA bot). CNCF is vetting the bot with a random examination of the contrib base, and also ensure all org members exist in all systems.
        * Target (soft target): Week after code freeze (when fewest PRs to k8s/k8s). May punt.
* Slack-infra [Jeefy]:
    * Discussion/Update
        * The switch on for the official Slack pronoun field (yay!). Not as much flak/negativity this time around, so that's good.
* Any other notes?
    * N/A

    * CoC [Host]
    * New Contributor Intro here \o/ [Everyone]
        * We all did intros :D
* Events:
    * Office hours [Jorge]
        * It happened today! No details, but it happened!
        * People were asking questions and it was engaging. We actually had *too* many volunteers for once
    * [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adztrJ05mQ_cjatYSnvyiy85KjuI6-GuXsRsP-T2R3k/edit#gid=932627810) [Laura]

        * Doodle is going out later today. Several folks said they can host, so that will be kicking up again.
    * Playground, gsoc, outreachy, LFX Mentorship Program [Ihor]
        * There was a call for mentors and projects. Lots of applicants, but no specific projects or mentors. Very few mentors with well-scoped projects in general in the past, so same problem here.
        * For the most part, we're reaching out to other groups and asking for bandwidth. The bandwidth problem has been a big one this past year.
        * Next mentoring meeting is on Monday 5p UTC/11a ET/8a PT
        * Mentoring PRs are coming in for group mentoring for reviewer pool
    * [New Contributor Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XiXjDWCc087VKqX2b6LMGRnlaRyLYGh2-eWQQr6dAmc/edit#heading=h.vs8waxtx792q) [Alison]
        * Will be one of the big focuses for the upcoming mentoring meeting
        * Lots of stuff spec'd out (slides and presentations), but need to decide what stuff needs to be recorded. Some of the smaller bite-sized stuff can be written tutorials right now. Just need to figure out the logistics.
        * Lack of people able to record and produce content for workshops.
        * See [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/labels/area%2Fnew-contributor-track](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/labels/area%2Fnew-contributor-track) 
        * Do we need a producer to track people down? Potentially. Do people need help editing? Potentially. Review at next mentoring meeting (see note above about timeframe for that meeting)
* Community-management:
    * [Need to Know Chairs/TLs email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC799hHZpo8JJfwvUa94uiPfUpo17oTTJDFobxNLL7c/edit) [Bob/Alison]

    * Helping push the Contributor Survey (Q: How many submissions do we have?)
        * [https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/S--Ia5Pjmmg?pli=1](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/S--Ia5Pjmmg?pli=1) 
        * [https://twitter.com/K8sContributors/status/1371535294227390464](https://twitter.com/K8sContributors/status/1371535294227390464) 
        * Results: as of yesterday: 55 respondees… One way to get more respondents is getting cofounders of the project/people with decent followings to post about it. But the hard thing is the non-contributors answering.
        * Opportunity to increase reach / fills: 
            * Reinforce the impact
            * Reinforce that “this looks familiar, but it’s incredibly important to us”
        * 130 response min because 10% of org stat
        * Definitely prefer quality over quantity.
        * Going to push to various Slack channels tomorrow (draft message going up today-ish)
        * Ideas welcome!
    * Articles in progress updated here: [https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/41](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/41) 
        * Series on contributor contribution in progress for k8s.dev (target KubeCon EU)

        * Audit is still progressing
        * If you happen to be involved in any other SIGs, please remind for reviewing outstanding issues to call out out-of-date or missing docs
    * Contributor Site [Bob/Jorge]
        * Got moved over to the Kubernetes org!
        * There is interest in localizing that content, and that will start up soon-ish (probably)
* GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    * Discussion/Update:
        * Only big thing is we are really in progress with renaming repos. Comms about k8s.dev rename. Please refer people to k8s.dev/rename for more info

        * No real update

    * [your name and topic here - should this be an issue against kubernetes/community?]
    * [eddiezane] Code freeze notifications on PR?

        * Example: [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99892#issuecomment-800862933](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99892#issuecomment-800862933)
        * Lots of people don't seem to read the bot notifications.
        * We should look at our other bot messages, but something does seem to be needed.
        * Release schedule is at k8s.dev/release. Maybe a banner would be helpful when a freeze is in effect?
    * [Bob] Prioritization spreadsheet
        * [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1glhdFcUdqYAByW16hujxK1X_0k9mt_nrkCO4POeDNbs/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1glhdFcUdqYAByW16hujxK1X_0k9mt_nrkCO4POeDNbs/edit#gid=0)
        * There's been some holes that have come up over the past year for various reasons.
        * Automation would be really helpful if possible over trying to find more/new people.

        * Opened [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5462](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5462) for more discussion. If I missed any context from last week's meeting, please feel free to correct me.
        * Also reached out to Paris separately re: SIG reporting updates as there's a discussion around changing the SIG reporting structure. Summarized the notes in [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5462#issuecomment-772656560](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5462#issuecomment-772656560), but basically steering is looking to increase async comms and reduce meeting load. There's already a lot of duplicated reporting with the annual report, kubecon updates, and weekly/biweekly/triweekly SIG meetings.

        * Thoughts to improve? 
            * Not necessarily reach out to leads 
            * Cover more subgroups

    * Some follow up ideas
        * Disclaimer on articles -- personal experience and not representative of the entire community experience
