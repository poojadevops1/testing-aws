            - [Bob] Some sensitive things can be uploaded so we state that it’ll be at least 24 hours until a video is uploaded for videos to be sanitized
            - [Chris] We need more folks for marketing
                - [Kaslin] We have a good number of folks, but need clear shadowing roles/processes
            - [Paris] Broadcast to k-dev

        - There have been issues with conflicting zoom meeting IDs and people winding up in different locations.
        - Shortlink routes to a different zoom link, old meeting ID has a different zoom ID
        - Goal to sort out current zoom ID issues before bringing up restarting the community meeting again

        - September will not be going on this round because of all of the Zoom stuff

        - The K8sContributors tweet automation is not able to create tweet threads (as far as Kaslin is aware). Such a usecase would have to be addressed manually. But please reach out and tell us more @contributor-comms on Slack or in our meeting!

- Welcome and recurring business [Host]
    - CoC [Host]
    - New Contributor Intro here \o/ [Everyone]
- Events:
    - Office hours [POP/Rawkode]
        - Seems to be going well?
    - [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adztrJ05mQ_cjatYSnvyiy85KjuI6-GuXsRsP-T2R3k/edit#gid=932627810) [Laura]
        - August is going to be the release retro
        - There was another discussion about whether the community meeting is worth persisting with the current model. Do we want to discuss that here?
            - Biggest problem is updating people’s calendars
            - We can export k-dev now! So should make a managed account easier to avoid the API limits :) We’re working on that. Comms is now the big thing. We need to define a plan for cutover. Laura will talk with comms to figure that plan out.
    - Contributor Summit(s) [Bob]
        - Going well!
        - Reg form is live. Comms and Website updates are incoming
        - Original plan/idea is still being followed.
        - Next big decision: Where to host social
        - Separate meeting on Mondays (you will get the invite if you’re on the contribex mailing list--join to get it added, or ask in the Slack channel)
        - SIG meet and greet spaces are available on Wednesday at some point.
    - Steering Election [Josh]
        - SC Elections: need EC members (first step)
            - Normally 3-person election committee, all from different employers
            - Josh: tech implementation
                - Using Electo
            - ??: Voter management
                - Maintaining list
            - ??: Comms
                - Sending out messages
                - Will reach out to the marketing team and ask (note can’t be Broberg or Short because they work at the same company as Josh)
            - If you’re interested in joining the committee, let Josh and Bob know
    - Other/Discussion:
        - N/A
- Mentoring:
    - Meet Our Contributors [Paris]
        - Now have Streamyard :tada:
        - Still need calendars to get figured out, like with the community meeting
    - Playground, gsoc, outreachy, LFX Mentorship Program [Ihor]
        - Kicking off the fall cycle soon (LFX mentoring)
            - [https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/tree/main/lfx-mentorship/2021/03-Fall](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/tree/main/lfx-mentorship/2021/03-Fall)
            - Dates are Sept 1 to end of Nov
            - Call for Projects going out soon
        - No updates for GSOC. End of program is end of August. 17 mentees this round.
            - Last year was ~18-19
    - [New Contributor Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XiXjDWCc087VKqX2b6LMGRnlaRyLYGh2-eWQQr6dAmc/edit#heading=h.vs8waxtx792q) Course [Alison]
        - Good chat about everything on Monday
        - Potentially getting tech writers from budget from Google (yay help!)
        - Still need to set up page layout, then need to translate current stuff to guide format (currently in talks and slides format)
        - There are a bunch of open issues in GitHub (prefix: NCW2). Jump on in! Mentoring meeting is on the SIG Contribex calendar.
        - This upcoming Summit in North America isn’t running a New Contributor Workshop, as a side note (and likely won’t do one at KubeCon again due to low usefulness/amount of people actually sticking around. Seems to be better with local Meetups).
        - As a replacement, see SIG Meet & Greet above in the contributor summit section.
- Community-management:
    - [Need to Know Chairs/TLs email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC799hHZpo8JJfwvUa94uiPfUpo17oTTJDFobxNLL7c/edit) [Bob/Alison]
        - Several things on the docket:
            - Contributor Summit stuff
            - Steering election reminder
            - General discussion around making tech leads mandatory along with terms and term limits
            - K-dev migration! Send it to *everything*
                - We need to set a timeframe. Set it to after the steering election? But calendar issues are acute right now.
                - If we do it now, we would need to start comms right now and do the cutover in August
                - We’d do a straight cutover. And we can remove bouncing emails, thankfully.
                - Elections wouldn’t be too affected *other than* permissions on Google Docs.
                - Moderation queues would be a big deal to get started. Every single new person posting would need to be approved, which would be everyone on a new Google Group.
                - Need a minimum of 5-6 people
                - We’d also need to block posting to that list at some point to help move over to the new list.
                - Biggest thing is coordinating the comms. We’re migrating, and k-dev will be first.
                - We can create the list now and start moving over docs and all while still in the initial comms phase.
                - How about migrating sig-contribex first? Or having a starting list to move to catch things...
                - Note that this migration is the Google Workspace Automation issue on GitHub
                - We also can do it for any list; the person who exports the list has to have admin access to the list.
                - Offer: k8s-infra as a guinea pig. Especially since the working group is becoming a SIG.
                - TODO: Recruit Team
                - TODO: Draft comms
                - TODO: Test with k8s-infra/contribex
                - TODO: Consolidate to one GitHub issue
- Devstats [Lauri]
    - No updates
- Marketing [Matt/Kaslin]
    - Discussion/Update
    - Quite a bit of work coming up!
    - Lots of asks moved over to the marketing agenda (thanks, Kaslin!)
    - Couple of articles in progress (SIG-Node and Contributor Summit)
    - Comms for registration and contributor summit stuff
    - Bart Farrell is doing great work with a video series from contributors
    - If you need help, ping the group at contributor-comms on Slack, join the meetings, or ping Kaslin!
- Contributor-documentation:
    - Contributor Guide [Bob]
        - No updates
    - Developer Guide [Erik/Joel]
        - No updates
    - Contributor Site [Bob]
        - No updates
- GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    - EasyCLA Migration
        - Biggest thing. We still want to try for next week, but the PR to add the support to the CI is still open. Has not been tested yet. A lot of back and forth going on.
            - [https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/22742](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/22742) (as soon as that merges, test so we can get it going :) )
            - Aaron is watching it
            - Theoretically, seamless migration.
            - Will loop in comms when we’re ready to launch
    - Recently, there are a lot of good first issues, but a lot of people aren’t giving enough context to make them good first issues. So a lot of people who pick up an issue are stuck and need help. Madhav has been trying to help and pinging authors for context. Has there been any discussion to have better prompts or otherwise encourage better context on the good-first-issue labels (versus just tagging it and not having enough context)?
        - Not really yet, but good question.
        - Anyone can tag. Probably would be good to send a reminder out.
        - Probably no better way to do it than the one at a time situation, unfortunately. The original author or someone with strong knowledge of the code needs to do it.
        - If you do it, feel free to note that you’re doing it on behalf of SIG Contributor Experience. And feel free to add the context if you already know. Be sure to ping on GitHub and Slack both.
        - What about a good-first-issue template? Checklists and everything. Might be hard to create across all of the repos, but yes
        - Note that a lot of issues start out as regular issues and then get flagged later.
        - A comment from a bot would probably help.
        - Contributor comms would be helpful here, too :) Kaslin added to the marketing agenda
- Slack-infra [Jeefy]:
    - Discussion/Update
        - Huddles are awful. The end.
        - Josh disabled a bunch and is working through them all.
- Open Mic/Discussion
    - [arnaud] domain validation for Search Console.
        - Last year, we were talking about this. Did we do this, or is it still needed?
        - Project was to improve the SEO of the .io website.
        - Arnaud has access to the console now (yay)
        - ~Probably need to reach out to docs~
        - We actually mean the shortcut links, so ignore some of the above comments. We’re talking about k8s.io
        - There is a problem here since we use so many short links
        - We can add text records in the management stuff.
        - Arnaud’s got this :) No big rush, though.

    - NCW at KCD Bangalore had over 75 attendees and 50+ people submitted their first PRs in contributor-playground!
    - Still need to get streamyard licensed for MoC
- Events
    - Community Meeting
        - Still hunting for July's host; call is out on Slack in #sig-contribex and #kubernetes-contributors (looking for another engaged host for the first handful of events, which is why this isn't an email out to k-dev just yet).
            - Paris volunteered as backup
        - Calendars are still a sore point
        - Some tentative topics are on the docket already for July
        - Still evaluating the format as our attendance has been low in comparison; as a reminder/note, we're thinking a lot of the problem is Zoom fatigue more than the format not working
    - Summit planning kicking off soon separately from main meeting
- Community Management
    - Kick off meeting with 1password scheduled, will begin plan of rollout soon
- GitHub Management
    - [Retain LGTM through squash](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/22663)

        - LF has been provided a dump of org members and anyone that has opened a PR within the past year to validate cla status
        - [WIP PR adding support for the different CLA context to the prow plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/22742)
        - Assuming both the groups and plugin can be done and tested, current target time frame is the week of August 9th
- Slack Infra
    - Slack Moderator Plugin went into CrashLoopBackOff
        - K8s infra working on monitoring solution

    - [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adztrJ05mQ_cjatYSnvyiy85KjuI6-GuXsRsP-T2R3k/edit#gid=932627810) [Laura]
        - Updates to guide, website, etc (open PRs)
        - Concern about a lot of work put on the hosts again. How can we get away from the requirement of the hosts needing to be majorly plugged in?
        - Also, count? ~30 people on the call. Publicity blitz didn't really get the turnout we'd like to see. There were no good discussions or questions.
        - Has the new format experiment failed?
            - Hard to get people to come when it's optional right now, also hard with calendar invite not being able to go out.
            - It probably will be a full year before the Zoom burnout ends.
            - Let's start with the calendar invite problem? We've basically lost the constant communication channel and people live by their calendars.
            - We really need to migrate k-dev to a managed kubernetes.io address… This is a lot of work to do.
                - KEP?
                - Might be a great first issue set for updating docs and such across the project. Hackday! The Google docs will possibly be the hardest part.
                - TODO: Create an issue and start talking about all of the things that need to happen for this migration.
    - Contributor Summit(s) [Bob/Deb]
        - Graphics finalization
            - Survey Monkey. Support request was sent in because the survey results were by number that didn't match the image… We're still waiting to hear back from SM Support (Ihor)
            - Clear winner is #2, but we don't know what 2 is. Deb will vote and we can see which one incremented by one.
        - Timeline for registration to launch?
            - We should start scheduling a meeting and have a team together to plan.
            - Recruit the full team :D
            - Then Doodle for a date. Guess probably is end of July/early August.
            - Then we can start programming
        - Reception search
            - Deb's working on venue search now
        - Video of space at venue will be coming in a month or so.
        - Result from online v in-person. 20% (24) in-person no matter restrictions; 26% (32) if company restrictions lifted, 18% (22) in person if international ok. 28% (34) virtually. 2% (3) don't plan to attend.
            - Guess: ~200. Think ⅔ of folks we're used to.
            - Google has explicitly allowed KubeCon
            - RH individual exception requests
            - Little startups mainly are as you feel comfortable
        - If these numbers flip because of variants or something, we're already planning for hybrid, so *should* be an easy switch for content. The things that will change are food/beverage, giveaways, etc.
    - Steering Election [Josh]
        - Get Electo properly packaged for Kubernetes infrastructure.
            - Could host on Equinix Metal cluster…
            - Go to test infra team? WG-k8s-infra?
            - There's a lot of options
            - Managed Google MySQL instance
                - This is ~$75/mo
        - Election in September
        - Announcements not quite yet. Later part of July.
        - Will pull list of contributors from devstats

    - Other/Discussion:
        - Streaming platform (Streamyard)
            - Update to double-check the login. Once it's paid for, we're good to go.
            - Can someone log in without creating an account? Can we pass credentials off to fill out finance data as an example?
                - They'll send an email with a passcode. You can pass that to someone else to login.
                - Currently set up to the [stream-team@kubernetes.io](mailto:stream-team@kubernetes.io) address
                - TODO: Ihor will get back to the group on this

        - Semi-blocked on Streamyard and calendar issues (see community meeting)
        - July clashes with US holiday

    - The potential k-dev migration and the planning involved!
        - We want to test switching with contribex. Probably step 1.
    - Coming up, lots of various small stuff for all of the SIGs (fallout from the annual reports)
        - We will probably get pinged to help with solving the YouTube uploads, getting meetings scheduled, etc. etc.
        - Not now, but soon.
    - Community survey [Josh]
        - Josh putting graphs together.
        - Anyone really want to poke around in the data and look for things? Ping Josh.

- Marketing [Matt/Kaslin]
    - A few requests coming in through Slack; good to work with the community meeting.
    - Talking about process, limitations, etc.
    - How to enable more people is a big conversation, so keep an eye out for that getting shared
    - Savita from the release team joined after hearing about marketing in the community meeting, and that communication channel is a big win!
- Contributor-documentation:
    - Contributor Guide [Bob]

            - WIP preview of listing the enhancements on the page ([https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/pull/222](https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/pull/222))
            - Arsh - Ingestion stuff
                - Currently can specify in YAML the repo URL and files to copy over. Still stuck on links.
                - Detecting the links in the files is part of the current line of work.
                - Next steps for the content ingestion script [@arsh]
                    - Bash script uses regexes; no issues currently because we haven't imported content that has links in code blocks.
                    - Next step should be looking for libraries that can pass links in markdown. Laura will hunt.
                    - Goal: Search for links and then get them all corrected, then drop them in the correct location in the repo.
- GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    - Upcoming: Issue in k/org - EasyCLA migration. Original timeframe was after code freeze, but right now, too little time to communicate and test. Now probably headed to the backup date. In short, in the works, but moving back.

    - No updates
- Open Mic/Discussion

## June 9th Meeting

- Host: Alison
- Notetaker: Laura
- Attendees:
    - Alison Dowdney
    - Laura Santamaria
    - Arsh Sharma
    - Eddie Zaneski
    - Sahdev Zala
    - Josh Berkus
    - Sheetal Joshi
    - Deb Giles
    - Bob Killen
    - Kendall Nelson
    - Cody Crudgington
- Welcome and recurring business [Host]
    - CoC [Host]
    - New Contributor Intro here \o/ [Everyone]
- Open Mic/Discussion
    - Script to ingest external content into the contributor site [#93](https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/issues/93), [Slack thread](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C1TU9EB9S/p1622097259050400) [@arsh]
        - Context: Current contrib site uses a lot of regex to find and fix links from a bunch of extra repos and sources. We want to replace the regex.
        - Current plan: First clone the repos and then rename to drop the directories and all to just have the .md info.
- Where are the rules for renaming the file coming from? Is there anything to keep in mind?
    - Outside of renaming the files, once you get to updating the links, then you have to do the fuzzy replace of the directory location to where it will exist in Hugo (on the contributor site)
    - The logs are the data to follow to help understand it.
- For now is it fine if we follow this structure -> clone, rename, replace links
    - Yep! Sounds about right. Review happening in a 1:1
- How would I know the URLs to be used for the links?
    - This is where the regexes come in, to look for links in the markdown docs. We want to get away from that to use the markdown library to do that (since regex picks up links in codeblocks that we don't want to change - e.g., links to a repo)
    - Bob will resync with Arsh after he has a moment to go back through the code.
    - [your name and topic here - should this be an issue against kubernetes/community?]
- Events:
    - Office hours [POP]
        - It is still set to go, that's what we know :)
    - [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adztrJ05mQ_cjatYSnvyiy85KjuI6-GuXsRsP-T2R3k/edit#gid=932627810) [Laura]
        - On the to-dos: Update the site page to mirror current process. Hope to get that PR in this week.
        - Josh volunteered to host June; happily will take more people signing up for other months!
        - Eddie's KEP!
            - [https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2777](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2777)
        - TODO - Ping contributor comms to ping all the slack channels (and add that to the hosting guide)
    - Contributor Summit(s) [Bob/Deb]
        - Don't forget the poll! Update: 99 people responded so far. Everyone wants something in person; 21 attend no matter what, 28 people if company travel lifted, 19 people attend if international, 26 virtual, 3 not planning on doing so. Only 15 people responded to the late-add question. Generally, people want to attend in person, and some will attend virtual if needed.
        - Registration released sometime in the next week or two.
        - Helpful: save the date. Can we get that up?
            - Yes, but put it on the contributor site to keep everything together.
            - Graphic options are available (for branding). The contrib site doesn't exactly have a theme, but happy to put up a banner! Watch Slack for options. LA theme
                - Put it to a vote at the community meeting! Deb will connect with Josh.
            - Hotel: JW Marriott
            - TODO: All details to get dropped in Slack so the site can get updated
        - Next: When should we do this? Day -1, Day 0?
            - Guess what, the colo events will happen both Monday and Tuesday :uh-oh:
            - Monday is probably our best bet still (Day -1)
            - Picking Monday, will disperse on Tuesday.
            - Will want to look into social activities for Monday night.
            - Maybe need rooms on Tuesday for a SIG to say they want a bit of time to meet
        - Maintainer track CFP still TBD
        - Planning for now will still be part of this meeting until we eventually need to meet separately.
    - Other/Discussion:
        - N/A
- Mentoring:
    - Meet Our Contributors [Alison]
        - Didn’t go ahead; event was missing on calendar and other issues like rescheduling the mentoring meeting so it doesn't conflict with MOC.
        - Need to sort out streamer for this or streamyard (aka who can host July?)
            - At this point, for streamyard, we're going to get there. Bob's looking up how to make this happen for a shared account. (Also working on 1Password - the OSS version)
        - Issue for July: First Monday is July 5, which is problematic for US folks.
            - Need to explore the right day/time for July being different.
    - Playground, gsoc, outreachy, LFX Mentorship Program [Ihor]
        - N/A

        - Updated the PR that was in motion :tada: Should be all squared away soon. Please review the PR if you're able/supposed to.
        - Aiming to get all the bootstrap stuff done by end of the week
        - Goal: Get Done by KubeCon NA, so October

    - [Need to Know Chairs/TLs email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC799hHZpo8JJfwvUa94uiPfUpo17oTTJDFobxNLL7c/edit) [Bob/Alison]
        - Drop an item in there if you need to
- Devstats [Lauri]
    - Updated to support individual repos/SIGs stats!
    - Pick dashboards we want to offer in a curated fashion to SIG/Subproject leads to embed in the contrib site (with interpretation info)
- Marketing [Matt/Kaslin]
    - Discussion/Update
        - Soon, there will be the ability to request tweets by opening an issue (which will do all the automation for the PR for you)
        - Note that it will not support image embeds as that's a limitation of the tool. Ping contrib-comms manually still for those
- Contributor-documentation:
    - Contributor Guide [Bob]
        - No updates
    - Developer Guide [Erik/Joel]
        - No updates
    - Contributor Site [Bob]
        - No updates
- GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    - Discussion/Update:
        - The big thing is the migration to EasyCLA (to replace current CLA bot). CNCF is vetting the bot with a random examination of the contrib base, and also ensure all org members exist in all systems.
        - Target (soft target): Week after code freeze (when fewest PRs to k8s/k8s). May punt.
- Slack-infra [Jeefy]:
    - Discussion/Update
        - The switch on for the official Slack pronoun field (yay!). Not as much flak/negativity this time around, so that's good.
- Any other notes?
    - N/A

    - New Contributor Intro here \o/ [Everyone]
        - We all did intros :D
- Events:
    - Office hours [Jorge]
        - It happened today! No details, but it happened!
        - People were asking questions and it was engaging. We actually had *too* many volunteers for once
    - [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adztrJ05mQ_cjatYSnvyiy85KjuI6-GuXsRsP-T2R3k/edit#gid=932627810) [Laura]
        - Email draft done and ready to go to review, along with a Google sheet

        - Doodle is going out later today. Several folks said they can host, so that will be kicking up again.
    - Playground, gsoc, outreachy, LFX Mentorship Program [Ihor]
        - There was a call for mentors and projects. Lots of applicants, but no specific projects or mentors. Very few mentors with well-scoped projects in general in the past, so same problem here.
        - For the most part, we're reaching out to other groups and asking for bandwidth. The bandwidth problem has been a big one this past year.
        - Next mentoring meeting is on Monday 5p UTC/11a ET/8a PT
        - Mentoring PRs are coming in for group mentoring for reviewer pool
    - [New Contributor Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XiXjDWCc087VKqX2b6LMGRnlaRyLYGh2-eWQQr6dAmc/edit#heading=h.vs8waxtx792q) [Alison]
        - Will be one of the big focuses for the upcoming mentoring meeting
        - Lots of stuff spec'd out (slides and presentations), but need to decide what stuff needs to be recorded. Some of the smaller bite-sized stuff can be written tutorials right now. Just need to figure out the logistics.
        - Lack of people able to record and produce content for workshops.
        - See [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/labels/area%2Fnew-contributor-track](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/labels/area%2Fnew-contributor-track)
        - Do we need a producer to track people down? Potentially. Do people need help editing? Potentially. Review at next mentoring meeting (see note above about timeframe for that meeting)
- Community-management:
    - [Need to Know Chairs/TLs email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC799hHZpo8JJfwvUa94uiPfUpo17oTTJDFobxNLL7c/edit) [Bob/Alison]

    - (Goal is no-code message) Message of low/no code is helping with recruits! 2 new consistent members. 🎉
    - Helping push the Contributor Survey (Q: How many submissions do we have?)
        - [https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/S--Ia5Pjmmg?pli=1](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/S--Ia5Pjmmg?pli=1)
        - [https://twitter.com/K8sContributors/status/1371535294227390464](https://twitter.com/K8sContributors/status/1371535294227390464)
        - Results: as of yesterday: 55 respondees… One way to get more respondents is getting cofounders of the project/people with decent followings to post about it. But the hard thing is the non-contributors answering.
        - Opportunity to increase reach / fills:
            - Reinforce the impact
            - Reinforce that “this looks familiar, but it’s incredibly important to us”
        - 130 response min because 10% of org stat
        - Definitely prefer quality over quantity.
        - Going to push to various Slack channels tomorrow (draft message going up today-ish)
        - Ideas welcome!
    - Articles in progress updated here: [https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/41](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/41)
        - Series on contributor contribution in progress for k8s.dev (target KubeCon EU)

        - If you happen to be involved in any other SIGs, please remind for reviewing outstanding issues to call out out-of-date or missing docs
    - Contributor Site [Bob/Jorge]
        - Got moved over to the Kubernetes org!
        - There is interest in localizing that content, and that will start up soon-ish (probably)
- GitHub-management [Bob/Nikhita/Christoph]:
    - Discussion/Update:
        - Only big thing is we are really in progress with renaming repos. Comms about k8s.dev rename. Please refer people to k8s.dev/rename for more info

        - No real update

        - Example: [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99892#issuecomment-800862933](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99892#issuecomment-800862933)
        - Lots of people don't seem to read the bot notifications.
        - We should look at our other bot messages, but something does seem to be needed.
        - Release schedule is at k8s.dev/release. Maybe a banner would be helpful when a freeze is in effect?
    - [Bob] Prioritization spreadsheet
        - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1glhdFcUdqYAByW16hujxK1X_0k9mt_nrkCO4POeDNbs/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1glhdFcUdqYAByW16hujxK1X_0k9mt_nrkCO4POeDNbs/edit#gid=0)
        - There's been some holes that have come up over the past year for various reasons.
        - Automation would be really helpful if possible over trying to find more/new people.

        - Opened [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5462](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5462) for more discussion. If I missed any context from last week's meeting, please feel free to correct me.
        - Also reached out to Paris separately re: SIG reporting updates as there's a discussion around changing the SIG reporting structure. Summarized the notes in [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5462#issuecomment-772656560](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5462#issuecomment-772656560), but basically steering is looking to increase async comms and reduce meeting load. There's already a lot of duplicated reporting with the annual report, kubecon updates, and weekly/biweekly/triweekly SIG meetings.
        - February community meeting: Should we move forward with the prior format? Current schedule is the working/user groups, and I was going to add in committees and SIG Arch from January's schedule if we're moving forward.

        - Thoughts to improve?
            - Not necessarily reach out to leads
            - Cover more subgroups
        - Consider focusing on the individual and their experience in the SIG to reduce the feedback churn (and sense that it has to be 100% representative of the experience)
    - Some follow up ideas
        - Disclaimer on articles -- personal experience and not representative of the entire community experience
        - Long-living SIG Profiling Quotes document where we get a few quotes, then theme them into an article on Friday meetings (AI: Matt to bring this back to Marketing on Friday)
