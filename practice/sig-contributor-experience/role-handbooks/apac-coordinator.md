# Contributor Experience APAC Coordinator

## Overview

The Kubernetes contributor base is still heavily skewed towards the US, and we are trying to diversify geographically. APAC Coordinator in Contributor Experience SIG helps to encourage and inspire more people in APAC regions to start contributing and ensure that there are adequate representations.

Some common tasks include:

- help with mirroring programs and strategies for contributors
- speak at meetups and local events about the work that happens in Contributor Experience SIG
- write blog posts about the same in multiple languages, coordinate translation when necessary
- help with regional boards on discuss.kubernetes.io
- help with regional channels on Slack
- run the APAC Contributor Experience SIG update meeting

APAC Coordinators currently meet at [5:00 UTC](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=05:00&tz=UTC) on Thursday every two weeks, the [meeting notes doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CBz8qV_mD6rbDmTsMuosTOQGRXGhN3d8UrcULUI6Vkw) is the same one as the SIG's, join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-contribex) to get the calendar invite.
