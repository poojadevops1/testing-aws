In contrast to what we would expect, those who are interested irrespective of the support available report more challenges in 2019 than in 2018 with finding issues to work on and finding the right SIG. Combining this finding with the cross tabulation above showing contributors across the spectrum responding more with unconditional interest suggests several things. One is that what the mentoring program is and how it could help may need more publication. The other may be that there is a sense of pride in not needing mentoring, and so finding a way to break down that stigma may lead to happier contributors in the long run."
