# Survey Analysis

This directory contains the analysis of surveys given to the contributor community.
Each individual survey's data and corresponding analysis are found in the directory
named after the corresponding year. The README.md in those directories contains the
full analysis done. For space reasons, the notebooks from which the README.md files
are derived have been cleared of output. 

In addition to the individual year analysis, multi-year comparisons can be found
in `multi_year_comparisons`.

To run the notebooks on your own, the following packages are required:

* pandas
* plotnine
* numpy
