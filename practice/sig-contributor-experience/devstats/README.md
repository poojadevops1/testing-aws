# devstats

This file documents the [devstats](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/) subproject.
We are responsible for continued advocacy of CNCF's devstats project within the kubernetes
community. The kubernetes project has a significant number of metrics
and workflows that are unique amongst CNCF projects, thus we are more
actively involved in ongoing development and maintenance of meaningful
devstats metrics and dashboards than most other CNCF projects.

## Suggesting improvements to devstats

To suggest improvements to devstats, please create an issue on the
https://github.com/cncf/devstats repo.

## Things we have done in the past

- Graph of the Week at kubernetes community meetings
  - TODO: list of meetings and graphs presented?
- Added descriptions to each of the devstats dashboards
- Adjusted repo groups to be generated from sigs.yaml instead of the
  previous subjective/opaque groupings
- Consulted with the devstats maintainers to suggest new metrics and
  new dashboards
