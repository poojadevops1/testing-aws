* Next week‚Äôs PR wrangler: _Holiday_
    * Approvers, make sure you know your scheduled [PR wrangler shifts](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/wiki/PR-Wranglers)

Agenda: 



* Release 1.20 retrospective
    * Anna: release went well
        * PRs piled up (avoid)
        * Good job with reviews and approvals
        * Comms comms (communication with SIG Release comms team especially for the blogpost release)
    * Open floor
    * Rey: thumbs up as a shadow / comms internal
    * Rey: getting things done early is good
    * Rey: some trouble around communicating important changes (eg deprecations)
    * Joseph: Anna killed it! From comms, no handbook mention of relationship
        * Unaware of SIG docs‚Äô ability to assist
        * Knowing of blog before day of would be good
        * Knowing of docs deadlines in comms would be good
        * Themes could improve (deadlines might help)
    * Kaitlyn: Historically the blog team has removed themselves from the review process. Helped if needed, but it would be good to make a decision if we want blog team review or not. Happy to help update the role handbook.
    * Anna: PR timing / who is responsible?
    * Jim: more than one way to do it. Docs release lead (or shadow) could meet with the release comms team, maybe halfway through the cycle, and pick an approach. _Doesn‚Äôt have to be the same approach every release?_ Could be more formal if needed.
    * Jim: slimming down the release handbook is a positive thing - it‚Äôs a living (resurrected?) document!
    * Tim: We did a good job for being an ‚Äúenabling‚Äù SIG. üéâüéâ
    * Celeste: Was kubecon timing a problem?
* 1.20 Release Retro (idea for 1.21)
    * Discussion for the release comms for deprecation [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5344#issuecomment-740218218](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5344#issuecomment-740218218) 
    * Anna: Move placeholder deadline to match code freeze (currently a week before)
    * Tim: easier for review / feedback over longer. However this may affect the suggestions on what kind of feature gate needs to be included on the docs. Opening a placeholder PR late could also be a signal if the feature is ready to be graduated since there‚Äôs also still a long list that needs to be done in the code /comms about the feature itself. 
* Blog Update
    * Nothing new and exciting
        * need to raise awareness on the process
        * Looking for more reviewers (please attend the blog team meeting on thursdays)
* Issues & PRs
    * (for next meeting) [Celeste]: [https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/pull/393](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/pull/393), [https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/22934](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/22934) 
        * Issue 1: WG Naming is okay with this in principle from a language perspective, but this replacement changes MongoDB to Redis. Is SIG Docs ok with this?
        * Issue 2: Paul may not have time to push these over the line ‚Äì can we take over the PRs?
* Discussion
    * Release 1.21 upcoming work
    *

Agenda



* Release 1.20
    * On course for release - Anna
    * Including blogs - PRs (only) done yesterday, ready to go post-release
        * Also good to cover in retrospective
* Blog Update
    * Kaitlyn - some articles not getting assigned to right people
    * Blog subproject meeting on Thursday
    * Might need help reviewing blogs w/ release
        * Rolfe DH / Chris Metz / Tim interested
* [Brad] Update from Monthly SIG Docs Localization subgroup meeting on 12/7/2020
    * Several issues discussed
    * Multiple styles for contributing localizations
        * 1st - most things up to date, tracking when the English pages are more recent than the last change to a localized page. ‚ÄúTypo fixes‚Äù mask whether or not the localized page is current with respect to English. Within this model there is also diff-based and timestamp-based approaches to work out what to sync.
        * 2nd - batched, behind the master branch of English. ‚ÄúTypo fixes‚Äù fine.
    * Accidental approvals by English-localization approvers (SIG Docs leads & chairs) are frustrating sometimes for localizations.
    * Some people don‚Äôt look at GitHub labels for messages, they look just at PR title. Some localization teams are going to recommend porefixing.
    * **AI:**  Brad to open issue to describe the issue faced by localization teams regarding timely update of .toml and .nd files that they don‚Äôt have authority to approve PRs on
* Issues & PR
    * Merging GSoDs API ref (??)
        * [https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/23294#issuecomment-736300275](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/23294#issuecomment-736300275) 
        * Tooling change merged, update for reference docs to follow v1.20 release
        * Next version for reference docs close, changes to preserve existing hyperlinks are important - Karen (very important) - Tim
        * Tim to log issue about preserving those existing hyperlinks
    * First Sig-Security-Docs Recommendation
        * PR: [https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/25498](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/25498)

Agenda



* Release 1.19
    * (not able to attend): Status is green. Dev-1.19 is healthy
* Blog
    * Tim - has one open article
    * 1 other needs review (Kevin?) from blog team - maybe turn into case study?
* Issues & PRs
    * [https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/22799](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/22799)
        * Add to tracking issue?
            * Issue to clean up how the CNI information is presented (and inlign with the KEP)
                * Does everything need a GitHub repo / be OSS?
                    * No [Tim]: SIG-Windows
        * Is this CNI provider up to date and installable a cloud native way?
        * Does this product align?
            * Review - does it align as a CNI? (consensus: NO, not CNI)
        * Outcome: open issue to clean up AI: Jim
            * Tasks / UI improvement (tag Tim)
        * Outcome (part2): Publicly define 3rd party content and call out page and requirements. AI: Celeste
    * CKA CNI Kubeadm docs [Jim]
        * [https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/22600#event-3587871540](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/22600#event-3587871540)
* Hugo & Docsy in a container for docs [Jim / Celeste / Joel]
    * Updated makefile and continuing work
    * [Kohei] README suggests yarn while the repo has package-lock.json but not yarn.lock. What‚Äôs the goal for the npm package management(inside or outside of the container)?
        * [Tim] We should use what Netlify uses (package.json)
        * [Kohei] had issues with npm ci, yarn worked, will double check
        * [Celeste] why is yarn here?
        * [Kohei]: opening issue and troubleshooting / tagging folks interested
* Localization struggles to keep up localization pages when things change.
    * [Jim] I thought this would be good to bring up from the APAC meeting
    * No great answer
    * Recommended reaching out to ko localization
    * AI: bring up at tuesday meeting
    * [Kohei]: not standardized, each localization has their own standard / team. Independent. (Can‚Äôt really force / make work a certain way). 
        * KO is doing things very well (milestones)
        * JA is automating tracking the diff (git commands)
        * Tips can be shared
    * [Brad] ZH / KO have tools (discussed at KubeCon shanghai)
        * Circle back to see if there‚Äôs ability for reuse
    * [Jim] Can we create a universal tool that shows diffs?
    * [Kohei] localization docs lack information on maintaining a repo (after getting started). KO forked this page and created their own with better information (branch strategy / maintain / and how-to translate [whole vs. half]).
        * Needs improvement for making own pages
    * [Tim] Normal flow is English -> Translation (good rule). For a localization page, maybe that rule bends.
    * [Tim] Anyone can jump into a localization channel
    * AI: Jim will open issue (scope of improving localization ongoing guides) but needs other folks to drive

Moved to the following week:



* Guidelines for promotion of localization thresholds
    * [Jim] I thought this would be good to bring up from the APAC meeting
    * When / how to promote localization contributors

        * How to clone the repo in periodic jobs. I notice that in presubmit jobs we only need to mention the orgz and repo‚Äôs name. Not sure if we need another auth for cloning the repo before doing the link check. On the other hand I notice that for each release we‚Äôre doing periodic jobs to detect flaky tests etc.

Agenda



* Docs
    * Release update 1.19
        * Deletion of release-1.xx (current) branch
            * **Context:** A release branch is cut at the end of a release that mirrors master so Netlify can be set up and configured. This branch is never used except when the NEXT release is cut (9+ months).
            * **Proposal:** delete the release-1.18 (current) branch and [Jim] update the handbook with instructions about cutting it ~1 week or days before the release + Netlify setup.
            * **Pros: **
                * Reduces ability for branch to be used incorrectly (causing conflicts)
                * Stops release team from pointless merge-syncs
            * **Cons:**
                * Adds a little more complexity to an already busy ‚Äúend of cycle‚Äù for docs release team.
                * Prevents future setting up of Netlify ‚Ä¶ kinda ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
            * **Lazy consensus?**
                * **No one‚Äôs against it :-) **

    * Gearbox (contractor) is currently doing the work

    * What is better? Seeing the template applied live to the site piecemeal or the site collectively is done: 
        * Other options: Ensure that it‚Äôs possible to switch in previews (feature flag) but not switch. Generate two netlify sites per build? Yes. 
    * Considerations: Allowing people to test the site, debugging, communicating out

    * Who‚Äôs going?
        * Brad, Zach, Celeste

Agenda



* Docs
    * What to do with third-party docs
        * Zach is still catching up
        * Backstory: Lots of vendor content in the docs already, and a lot of vendors submitting PRs to promote their technology, which doesn‚Äôt actually help new users understand and use kubernetes itself. 
        * We support ‚Äúwhat helps run default kubernetes in-tree‚Äù. - Seems like folks agree on this :)
    * API Docs
        * More of an issue than we thought

        * Any reference to archives will point to the community repo
        * 2019 backup (if needed ASAP): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E0oCkvNys1vTjyGucKOWv1b52ld-eqw5XLNT1SvHeNY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E0oCkvNys1vTjyGucKOWv1b52ld-eqw5XLNT1SvHeNY/edit?usp=sharing)
