# Archiving meeting minutes

At the beginning of each year, archive the old Google docs into this repo to improve the performance of the current doc.

### Convert meeting minutes into markdown:

1. Make sure you have a document (new or exisiting) with exactly the content you wish to store.
2. Install [Docs2Markdown](https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki#using-docs-to-markdown)
3. Open up Google Doc > Add-ons > Docs2Markdown > Convert [Markdown] (taking the unselected defaults)
4. Select the output and paste into a document
5. Add the new document to this repository

> Message #sig-docs on slack if you need help!
