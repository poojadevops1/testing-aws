## Why Me

I have been facilitating the Steering Committee with automating and
unifying many organizational processes. Due to this, I am already familiar with
the responsibilities associated with the role and would love to formally help
with governance aspects.

Being a Steering Committee member sometimes involves doing the "unexciting and
boring" parts of maintaining a project. I have never shied away from such
tasks and have been regularly contributing with lots of "unglamorous" work.

If given a chance, I would love to do more chopping wood and carrying water
for the project! :)

## What I do

- I started contributing two years ago as a
[Google Summer of Code (GSoC) intern](https://github.com/nikhita/gsoc-meta-k8s).
I had a wonderful experience and wanted to give back - now, I help run the
[GSoC](https://github.com/cncf/soc) and [Outreachy](https://git.k8s.io/community/mentoring/outreachy.md)
internship programs for Kubernetes.

- Currently, I am a Technical Lead for SIG Contributor Experience and
am on the [GitHub Administration Team](https://git.k8s.io/community/github-management#github-administration-team).

- I can be seen [tinkering with prow plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Anikhita)
and triaging issues to help improve the contributor experience.

- As a part of SIG API Machinery, I have written [design](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/708/)
[proposals](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/913)
and authored several features regarding CRDs. I also work on the release process
for client-go.

- I am active in SIG Release and maintain the [publishing bot](https://github.com/kubernetes/publishing-bot)
and the licensing subproject.

- I also love adding emojis in Slack and GitHub reviews so that it remains a
friendly environment for everyone! :rainbow:

## What I will do

- Nurture an inclusive, diverse, empathetic and open community.
- Drive staffing efforts towards unowned areas in the project
to improve the overall project stability.
- Improve reviewer/approver scalability and facilitation of knowledge transfer
to prevent contributor burnout, and to enable and empower part-time contributors.
