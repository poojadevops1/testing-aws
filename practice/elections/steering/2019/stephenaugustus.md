## What I plan to do as a Steering Committee member...

In all I do, I try my best to find ways to improve the project through understanding and elucidating our governance principles.

I've had the opportunity to demonstrate my belief in and the value of developing project-wide process through my continued work in horizontal SIGs, and I believe that Steering is the next logical place to serve.

My continued goals (on or off Steering) include:

- Nurturing efforts that support underrepresented / marginalized groups in technology
- Encouraging the growth of new project leaders, through both example and active mentorship
- Removing friction from the contribution process, especially for new contributors
- Maturing processes that increase our reviewer / approver base
- Driving deeper adoption of the [KEP] process project-wide
