# 2019 VOTERS GUIDE - KUBERNETES STEERING COMMITTEE ELECTION

## Purpose

The role of this election is to fill out the four (4) seats due for
reelection this year on the [Kubernetes Steering Committee]. Each elected
member will serve a two (2) year term.

## Background

This election will shape the future of Kubernetes as a community and project.
While SIGs and WGs help shape the technical direction of the project, the
[Steering Committee Charter] covers the health of the project and community
as a whole. Some direct responsibilities of steering members to consider as you are deciding
whether to run or who to vote for:

* Through the chartering review process, delegate ownership of, responsibility
  for and authority over areas of the project to specific entities
* Define, evolve, and defend the non-technical vision / mission and the values
  of the project
* Charter and refine policy for defining new community groups and establish transparency and accountability policies for such groups
* Define and evolve project and group governance
  structures and policies
* Act as a final non-technical escalation point for any Kubernetes repository
* Request funds and other support from the CNCF (e.g. marketing, press, etc.)
* Define and enforce requirements for community groups to be in good standing
  such as having an approved charter

For more context, please see the [current steering committee backlog] or a
previous [governance meeting video] which led to this whole process.

## Candidacy Process

**Nomination**

If you want to stand for election, send an email to kubernetes-dev@googlegroups.com
with the subject line "Steering Committee Nomination: Your Name (@yourgithub)".

If you want to nominate someone else, you may do so, but PLEASE talk to them
first.

If you wish to accept a nomination from someone else, reply to the nomination
email saying something like "I accept the nomination"

**Endorsement**

Once nominated, you must get the endorsement of three (3) different eligible
voters from three (3) different employers.  If you are eligible to vote
yourself, you count as one of the three.

[Eligible voters] may endorse candidates of their choosing by replying to the
candidate's nomination email saying something like "I endorse this nominee"
or "+1". Please specify your github ID and state that you are in voters.md.

**Running**

Eligible candidates must submit a pull request with a biography in this
directory with their platform and intent to run. This statement is
**limited to 300 words** and must follow the format of `firstnamelastname.md`.
Please refer to the [2018 candidate bios] for examples.

**Campaigning**

Please refer to the [Steering Committee Election Charter] and understand
that we care deeply about [limiting corporate campaigning]. The election
officers and members of the steering committee [pledge to recuse] themselves
from any form of electioneering.

You should be running as a "brand free" individual, based on your contribution
to the project as a member of this community, outside of whatever corporate
roles you may hold.

## Voting Process

Kubernetes members in [voters.md] will receive a ballot via email. If you are
not on that list and feel you have worked on Kubernetes in a way that is NOT
reflected in GitHub contributions, you can use the [voter exemption form] to ask
to participate in the election.

Elections will be held using time-limited [Condorcet] ranking on [CIVS]
using the [IRV method]. The top vote getters will be elected to the open
seats.

Employer diversity is encouraged, and thus maximal representation will be
enforced as spelled out in the [Steering Committee Election Charter].

You will be ranking your choices of the candidates with an option for
"no opinion". In the event of a tie, a coin will be flipped.

The election will open for voting the morning September 28, 2019 via email and
end two weeks after on October 2, 2019 at 00:00am UTC. You will receive an email
to the address on file at the start of the election from "Kubernetes (CIVS Poll
Supervisor) `<civs@cs.cornell.edu>`, please whitelist if necessary. Detailed
voting instructions will be addressed in email and the CIVS polling page. Please
note that email ballots might be unreliable, so you are encouraged to contact
the election officials if you do not receive a ballot by September 29.

### Officers

The Steering Committee has selected the following people as [election officers]:
- Ihor Dvoretskyi, @idvoretskyi, CNCF
- Jorge Castro, @castrojo, VMware
- Bob Killen, @mrbobbytables, University of Michigan
- Brian Grant, @bgrant0607, Google

Please direct any questions via email to <election@k8s.io>.

### Decision

The newly elected body will be announced in the weekly [Kubernetes Community Meeting]
on October 3, 2019.

Following the meeting, the raw voting results and winners will be published on the
[Kubernetes Blog].
