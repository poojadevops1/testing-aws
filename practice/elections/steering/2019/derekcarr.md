## About me

I joined in 2014 as an early external contributor.  Over the years, I have loved
working with everyone to collaboratively build an amazing community and
technology. I have participated in multiple sub-projects helping to mentor new
contributors with code and coaching on technology and process to grow scope and
sustain the project.

I co-lead SIG Node and advocate for expanded workload support and improvements
to node reliability.  Early in the project, I was able to contribute initial
support for namespaces, quotas, limits, and internal machinery like admission
control.  I continue to help maintain those areas in the project with the
broader community and use my experience to inform my participation in SIG
Architecture.

In my service as a SIG chair and steering committee member, I try to listen,
find consensus, and empower others.  I have a pragmatic approach to problem
solving that prefers minimal solutions.

## Where I see myself contributing

What started as a small open source project has grown into a mission critical
system for the world.  I hope to continue to serve as a responsible steward of
the community that we all depend upon.

Areas of focus

- Delegate and empower others to meet the shifting needs of the project
- Coordinate and unblock challenges that span SIGs
- Responsibly sustain and grow contributor pool across all disciplines
- Support an inviting, fun, and collaborative environment to build together
