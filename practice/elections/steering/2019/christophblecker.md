## How I contribute

I got involved in the Kubernetes project in 2016, became a
member/reviewer/approver in 2017, and a [maintainer] in 2018.

I'm a Technical Lead for [SIG Contributor Experience], a founding member of the
[Kubernetes Infrastructure Working Group], and a regular contributor to [SIG
Architecture], [SIG Testing], and [SIG Release].

I founded and manage the [GitHub Administration Team], which is responsible for
holding our Org Owner privileges and overseeing our GitHub footprint.

I'm a recipient of the 2018 Chop Wood / Carry Water award.


## What I have done

Since joining the project, I have developed a reputation for picking up the
difficult, non-glamourous parts of open source work, and making things happen.
Whether it's code or people, I don't mind tackling the stickier parts of the
project and working to make them better, even just incrementally.

I'm a passionate advocate for our contributor base, new and experienced alike.
With the speed that the Kubernetes project moves, it's easy to become
disconnected from the needs of those who may not subscribe to all our e-mail
lists, chat in our Slack all day, or join our regular calls. I started as a
non-corporate-sponsored contributor myself, and aim to bring those perspectives
to the steering table.

## What I'll do

If elected, I aim to bring the voice of the contributor to the steering table. I
hope to bring my ability to make tough decisions, ask tough questions, and do
the hard work needed to allow that passionate contributor base to keep moving
this project forward.
