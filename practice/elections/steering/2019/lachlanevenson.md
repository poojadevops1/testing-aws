# Lachlan Evenson

G'day, I'm [lachie83](https://github.com/lachie83) on Github, Slack and @LachlanEvenson on Twitter

## What I've Done

As a long-time member (early 2014) of the Kubernetes community I have served in many capacities. I started as an end-user and then moved to more active community roles including:

* SIG PM Chair: improving the KEP process and sharing the process to the community at different ecosystem events
* Release team: 1.16 release lead, 1.15 lead shadow, 1.14 enhancements shadow
* Lead PM: IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack Kubernetes enhancement
* CNCF Ambassador

I have witnessed the impact of the Steering Committee over the years and would like to continue to build on that legacy.

## What I'll Do

I am specifically passionate about building the supporting structures to help scale contributions whilst actively focusing on intervening in processes that lead to contributor burnout. My experiences over the years provide me with a well rounded context in which to make effective decisions. It is my hope that by serving on the Steering Committee, I can help continue to build a safe, supportive, inclusive and collaborative environment for the project to flourish.
