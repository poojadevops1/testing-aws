What I've Done
--
I'm comparably new to Kubernetes upstream;
I started contributing in late 2018 after years of being a user.
I'm currently a part time contributor, and mostly contribute independently.

I primarily contribute in SIG-Network, where I focus on bugs, code cleanup, and SIG organization.

I also recently co-founded SIG-Usability, as a SIG lead.

Aside from those SIGs, you can find me all over the project with the odd PR, bug report,
or community outreach.

Why I'm Running, And What I'll Do
--
I care deeply about Kubernetes, and the people behind it.
We are at a crucial time in the project, as we improve our maturity and start to look at what's next.
I'm running because I believe we need all kinds of perspectives and people to make that happen successfully.

There are 3 areas I want to focus on: reliability, usability, and contributor empowerment.

I want to incentivize attention and work toward under-prioritized areas of the project
(such as documentation, scalability, and usability).

I want to help reduce the barriers to new contributors,
especially to allow more part time contributors, like end-users.
If we ensure our users' interests are well represented at the table,
we are more likely to create a valuable and usable Kubernetes.

Lastly, but most importantly, I will empower my fellow contributors in the project.
To me, the spirit of open source is people coming together, throwing ideas at the wall,
and making the world a better place by collaborating.
I want to do everything I can to foster and protect that spirit in the project, so that individuals can bring their best self - ideas and work -
without being bogged down by corporate interests.
