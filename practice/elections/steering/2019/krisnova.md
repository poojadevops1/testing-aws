More about [me](https://github.com/kris-nova/me)

## Why me?

I want to push myself, and our community. Taking on a leadership role like this excites me, and gives me energy.
I want to understand more about how Kubernetes is able to solve problems at scale, while also bringing my experience to the table.
Furthermore, I think having a diverse set of ideas in our steering committee will help keep our technology balanced and clever.

I have worked with major drivers in the Kubernetes space, both in OSS and professionally. I have seen a lot of leaders in Kubernetes implement change in a number of ways.
As I have been watching and working closely with these folks, I have been taking notes. I think Kubernetes is at a phase where we need protection and enablement for our contributors, and less top-down change.

Let's let our contributors do what they do best: build amazing software. 

## What I will do

Enable folks to be as productive as possible. Most of us have day jobs, and we all have our own agendas for work in Kubernetes.
My interest in joining is to serve as a guardian for the contributors, while empowering our many sigs with anything they need to be as useful and productive as possible.

The implementation detail here could mean a lot of things, but overall my sentiment would be to speak for the SIGs - and their best interest.


I hope you consider me for a steering committee member this year.
