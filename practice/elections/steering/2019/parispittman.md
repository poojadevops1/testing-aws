## Contributions

- Co-Chair, [Contributor Experience], 22 months  
- Subproject Owner:  
   - [contributor events] (summits, elections);
   - community management ([operational tactics], [guidelines], and policies aligned with [governance docs] (meetings, communication, etc.) for 40+ community groups: SIGs, WGs, committees, and user groups). I call it the transparency pipelines. :smile:  
   - [mentoring]  
  (outreachy, #meet-our-contributors, onsite sessions at KubeCon, group mentoring, empowering SIGs to create shadow roles/teams, hands on learning, and more);
- Member of first [Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee]  
- Work with Steering and/or CNCF directly on funding, process improvements, and contributor events and needs. Proposed and advocated for a contributor summit sustainability plan for a funding model that allows us to have logo free spaces among other things which aligns with our community > product or company [values].
- I've never missed a pubic steering committee meeting to date;   
I try to provide context to decision makers.

:sparkles: tl;dr: focus on governance operations, contributor growth, advocating for contributor matters to CNCF and Steering, and trying to figure out how to glue it all together. :sparkles:  


## What Iâ€™ll do :bowtie:
:checkered_flag: Continue to uphold the [values],  
:checkered_flag: Continue to clean up governance documentation, educate our large contributor base on governance topics,  
:checkered_flag: Encourage more dialogue with the steering committee and members of the community;  
:checkered_flag: Continue to work on project wide communications, like the [Need to Know Chairs] email, but at a steering committee level  
:checkered_flag: Delegate decision making to the appropriate owners and/or SIGs or work to ensure there is a communicated decision making path with the committee on unresolved matters
