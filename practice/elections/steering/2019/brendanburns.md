## My history with Kubernetes
I was one of the original creators of the proof of concept demo system that eventually turned
into Kubernetes. I wrote much of the original Kubernetes codebase as well as
the overall system design. I helped set up the initial
trajectory and inclusive culture of the Kubernetes community. I was in the bootstrap
committee that wrote the original governance structure for Kubernetes. More recently
I worked to broaden the base of people who can use Kubernetes via efforts like
usability and client libraries for different languages. I also help shape the future of technology
on top of Kubernetes like the Service Mesh Interface (SMI) and more.

## Where I see myself contributing
I have two unique areas to contribute. The first is a sense of history and continuity having been with the
project from it's very origin through the current day. This history helps me understand the context of the
decisions we are making today and how we have thought about it in the past.

The other is a sense for the importance of a broad, vibrant and effective community. 
Our community is the part of the project that I'm most proud of. It's the most unique
thing that we have built. I will work to preserve the best of what we've built and improve
the parts that can be improved to make us even stronger, more inclusive and more capable.
