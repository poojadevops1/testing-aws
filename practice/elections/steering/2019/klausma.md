## What I've Done

I've been involved in the Kubernetes project since ~2016, and have worked on distributed system for 10+ years. During my journey
on the project, it's really lucky to meet lots of great folks and have worked on various roles in the kubernetes community:

* SIG Scheduling (Lead)
* kubernetes-sigs/kube-batch (OWNER)
* SIG Apps, Node (Contributor/Reviewer/Approver)
* CNCF Research User Group (Tech Lead, on-going)

In addition to the work in the community, I also play as a advocate for Kubernetes on technical introduction and contributing guidance
in several conferences and meetups.

## What I'll Do

1. Serve to governance model to empower different stakeholders in the community
1. Serve to SIG/WG/UG to take ownership on different areas and workloads
1. Serve to community to encourage current/new contributors/users
