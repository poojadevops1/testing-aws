## SIGS
- sig-architecture
- sig-testing
- sig-release
- sig-node

## What have i done

Help nudge things along in Issues and PRs in the main k/k repository. Served on the Steering Committee since 2018 (one 2 year tenure).

Filed issues, worked on features, fixed bugs as well in Kubernetes.

Regularly participate in various cross cutting SIGs like Architecture, Contrib-Ex, Testing, Release etc. Currently co-chair of SIG-Arch, WG-k8s-Infra.

For various releases i have helped with triaging issues, maintain milestones for PRs and Issues, dig into CI failures etc.

I like to research old outstanding issues that bother a lot of users and try to come up solutions.

Help with things that hinder the contribution process for folks who do not work full time on kubernetes and try to pitch in to make it better for them.

Specific items i have helped drive: 
- run code-organization sub-project for SIG-Arch. Help with Conformance related discussions as well.
- breaking up things like klog and openstack cloud provider code into a separate repository with their own CI.
- bootstrapping the cluster-api-provider for openstack
- enabling multi-arch support for conformance tests and release artifacts.

## What i would like to do

Having been part of various Open Source projects and foundations i would like to ensure that Kubernetes will be vibrant and resilient over the ups and downs of the hype curve.

We are currently optimized for large-ish teams with full time contributors and i am keen on improving participation of individuals who are occasional contributors but with real world needs.

Build better bridges with the broader ecosystems and other open source projects and teach/learn from each other.
