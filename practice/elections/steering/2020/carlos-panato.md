## What I have done

  - Start contributing more to Kubernetes repositories around 2018, and before that, it was more inside the companies I used to work.
  - Today I contribute more for SIG-Release, acting as a branch manager to build and release Kubernetes to the wild.
  - Contribute to all things related to Cluster API project and focus my contribution on Azure and Digital Ocean, starting working more with Packet.
  - I try to help to onboard my branch managers in the SIG-Release and any other member who has any questions.

## What I'll do

  - I will try to get onboard contributors underrepresented by making the process more inclusive and having more formal mentorship programs and knowledge transfer.
  - I will keep the community safe and welcoming.
  - I will try to incentivize the attention to understaffed work, like documentation
  - Have fun with the steering committee, and try to spread the joy across all sigs.


## Resources About Me

  - I'm not a public speaker/blog writer, so I don't have videos/blogs. Most of my things are trying to answer questions from people that get in touch with me.
