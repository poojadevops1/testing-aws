## What I have done
- SIG API Machinery: I am co-chair. 
-- We ran [SIG meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9RNaaysyO0gXHIr1y50QFbiL1x8OWnk2v3XnrdkT5Y/edit#) twice a month to discuss important topics of the SIG.
-- For the last 2 years and a half we've been running twice a week bug and PR triages. This meeting was initially an internal meeting, which I proposed and succeeded at making it open to the entire community. 
- In 1.16 we've graduated the Kubernetes extensibility mechanisms to GA (Webhooks and CRDs) 
- WG server side apply: meetings, planning and resourcing to bring this feature to the current state of Beta 2 
- I participate on relevant meetings of SIG Architecture.
- I was involved in SIG Cloud Provider for almost a year 

## What I'll do
- I will make sure the Kubernetes Community stays an open and inclusive place
- I will make sure respect for each other is at the top of our values
- I will make sure the Kubernetes ecosystem stays company agnostic
- I will work in a plan to onboard new contributors. Who will be maintaining Kubernetes 5 years from now? Who will be our successors? How can someone ramp up and be productive?  Clear programs, material, mentorship, and code review open sessions are some of my ideas.
