## What I have done

I've been a Kubernetes end-user since 2016, focusing on hacking, security hardening, and threat modeling. I'm a relatively recent org member, but I've been engaged with the community for a long time, giving talks and spreading awareness externally as well as going to SIG meetings and helping people with issues internally.

While my technical work involves more breaking than building, I strongly focus on building relationships and connections between people. I believe we can all learn a lot from each other's perspectives, which can help us build stronger, more secure systems overall. I pride myself on bringing people together, making sure everyone feels seen and heard.  

## What I'll do

I've been a community organizer since my teens, and I’d love to bring that passion and energy for making things better to the Steering Committee!

As someone who does a lot of external community engagement, I get to hear perspectives that are often less heard internally. Kubernetes has an increasingly large, disconnected population of end-users, who aren’t currently being reached or served. I want to help bring those voices to the table, bridge those gaps, and fight for the users.

Representation matters. As someone coming from a non-traditional background, I will bring a voice and perspective to the Steering Committee that will allow many who don’t often see themselves represented to see someone like them in a position of governance.
