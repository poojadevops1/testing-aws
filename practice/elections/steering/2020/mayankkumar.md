## SIGS
- SIGS/WG/UGs you're a member of
  - Member: sig-apps, sig-architecture, sig-scheduling, sig-auth, sig-api-machinery, sig-storage, sig-network
  - Code reviewer: sig-apps, sig-node, sig-auth

## What I have done
- roughly 40 small code contributions
- shipped RunAsGroup feature as alpha and took it to beta
- added some enhancements and proposal 
- currently adding maxUnavailable to statefulsets
- actively code review and triage certain areas like sig-apps, sig-scheduling, sig-node
- participated thrice in mentoring sessions at kubecon as a mentor
- was a shadow for [bug triaging](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/4bd33253b1b2641ee77dd9a423685442d751361c/releases/release-1.14/release_team.md) in 1.14
- organized a [tech debt](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/c0733c8f4db10fd3859ca0ee3c251cef787db421/events/2019/11-contributor-summit/unconference-notes/tech-debt-Mayank.md) session at kubecon 

## What I'll do
- help bring new contributors to start contributing and make it easy for them to contribute small bug fixes and tests.
  Brainstorm delegation model to sub delegate authority for faster contribution model for tiny fixes.
- being part of an Enterprise company, I want to bring the Enterprise angle to all Kubernetes sigs. 
- been involved with kuberenetes since 1.2, I have seen it evolve as both as a user while helping Salesforce adopt it
  and also as a contributor. Would like to help improve its adoption and steer its vision with the context i have built.
- usability and reliability is another area where i will try sigs to priortize it.
- Lastly, i think there is a growing ecosystem around Kubernetes becoming a managed solution
  in each cloud provider(EKS,GKE,AKS). I think there 
  is a need for guidance and standardization while still allowing each of these cloud providers to innovate. I dont exactly 
  know how, but i am sure lot of the users feel some pain here.
