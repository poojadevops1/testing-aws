## What I've Done

As a long-time member (early 2014) of the Kubernetes community I have served in many capacities. I started as an end-user and then moved to more active community. I have witnessed the impact of the Steering Committee over the years and would like to continue to build on that legacy. As a member of the Steering Committee for the last six months, I have worked hard to support the community throughout this time and have aided in making swift decisions to build a safe and inclusive community. This includes the requirement for unconscious bias training for all community and chairs along with the creation of the annual reports. 

In my short time on the Steering Committee I have really enjoyed serving the community in navigating this difficult time globally and would appreciate the opportunity to serve a full term.

## What I'll Do

I am specifically passionate about building the supporting structures to help scale contributions whilst actively focusing on intervening in processes that lead to contributor burnout. My experiences over the years provide me with a well rounded context in which to make effective decisions. It is my hope that by serving on the Steering Committee, I can help continue to build a safe, supportive, inclusive and collaborative environment for the project to flourish.
