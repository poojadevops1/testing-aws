## What I have done

Most of my work within the Kubernetes org relates to pruning and editing - whether it be processes or their underlying documentation.

- Dedicated contributor to k/website repository
- k8s storyteller on the upstream marketing team - https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/communication/marketing-team
- Release 1.19 Docs shadow - https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.19/release_team.md
- Working on RT Prioritization items for bettering our release processes

As someone who is passionate about community-drive initiatives, my efforts span beyond the Kubernetes project. Apart from the project, I serve a few open source communities under different capacities. I'm one of the DOCS Leads for LitmusChaos(a sandbox project inducted by CNCF) and am also an active contributor to Ortelius. I pride myself on being a quick learner and a people person - two aspects that, I believe, help me build & sustain connections within & outside of the community.

## What I'll do

- Ensuring that the project continues to be a safe & welcoming space for the diaspora of Kubernetes enthusiasts irrespective of their diversity in technical proficiency, nationality, gender, race, or color is one of my top priorities. Coming from a traditional tech background, I'm keen on ensuring that positions of governance & leadership are more diverse & representative of the communities they serve.

- Improving the sustainability of the project is another key area that I'd want to focus on. I'd like to make the processes more inclusive for folks who aren't able to contribute to the upstream project on a fulltime basis & am also keen on bettering the processes surrounding knowledge transfer from existing community members.

- Given the ever-evolving nature of our project, reconciling the governance structure & policies to keep up with the times is extremely essential. I'd like to continue the good work that is already being done in this area and further reduce the overheads & redundancies towards bettering the experience for all our community members.
