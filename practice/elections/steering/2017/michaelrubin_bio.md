## About Me

I have been a software engineer, technical manager, and leader for
~20 years.  I am passionate about helping projects and people thrive.
Today I lead a number of Kubernetes teams at Google, including Storage,
Networking, Multi-cluster, Node, and more.

I love coding and technology, but even more than that I love mentoring
others and helping them to have impact and grow professionally.  This is
why I choose to support teams and projects as a technical manager.

My leadership style is to bring sharp focus to technical efforts, and
to help others become successful leaders, themselves.  I find that many
technology problems are not purely technical, and one of my biggest
strengths is my ability communicate, connect with people, and get to
the root of a problem.  People are not machines, and they need different
skills than just pure engineering.

During my 1.5 years with Kubernetes, I have worked directly and
indirectly with several SIGs - Storage, Multi-cluster, Networking,
Scheduling, and Node.  I think I have brought clarity and structure to
the efforts, helped organize priorities and roadmaps, and helped the
teams and individuals grow.  I have built lasting relationships with
the people of Kubernete, and not just the code.

As a member of the Steering Committee, I would focus on:

 * Cross SIG efforts and how to co-ordinate them
 * Getting more things out of core, but keeping them part of Kubernetes
 * Maintain the cool, open and inviting environment we have today
 * Delegate and empower others by adding structure (not process)
