## Why me?

The steering committee represents a unique convergence of my passion for servant leadership, organizational dynamics, inclusion, advocacy, and process optimization. It's always my highest purpose to be a voice and advocate for those I serve.  And, if elected, I will faithfully serve the ever-changing, sometimes divergent, and always important needs of the Kubernetes community.

## Servant leadership

Since my first moments in the community, I have sought out every opportunity I can to make things better.  I wrote an article about this called [What Kubernetes means to me](http://bit.ly/k8s2me) that will shed some light on my journey to this point. My contributions to the community currently include leading the 1.8 release team, co-leading SIG Azure, SIG Architecture, and SIG Cluster Ops (although Rob Hirschfeld has been covering for me while I work on the release).  I have facilitated every release retrospective since 1.3, and have improved my typing skills by note taking at countless SIG meetings.  I also work behind the scenes on Community things with Sarah and Jorge.  

## Career

I've been in love with systems, networks, and the human elements of interconnectivity since I was a SysOp on a BBS as a teenager. My first hack was in grade school, making the Oregon Trail game say naughty things.  In the time since, I have been a systems and network engineer, and held several engineering management directorships at companies large and small.  At Microsoft, all I do is Kubernetes, so I definitely have the organizational support to carry out my duties on the committee.
