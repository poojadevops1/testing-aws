# [Ilya Dmitrchenko](https://github.com/errordeveloper)

## Manifesto

Ilya has been contributing to Kubernetes since 2014. The focus of his contributions has been on solving
general cluster provisioning and bootstrap problems and making networking easier. For example in 2016,
he did the groundwork on the initial version of `kubeadm`.

Ilya is a DX engineer at Weaveworks and is based in London. From there he travels (mostly in Europe) to
educate the wider community about the benefits of containers and orchestration with Kubernetes. Ilya
would be delighted to represent the European users as a member of the steering committee.

Most recently, he started participating in organised community activities whose aim is to solve the
problems and the needs of end users who have Kubernetes in production or who are looking to put it in
production. To that end, he is a member of the London Production User Council, and together with other
contributors launched Kubernetes Office Hours.

To learn more about Ilya's background and why he deeply cares about the community, please take a look at
