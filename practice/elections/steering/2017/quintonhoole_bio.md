# About Me

Currently I'm Technical Vice President of Cloud Computing At Huawei
Technologies (185,000 employees globally, US$75BN annual revenue
(2016), 32% annual revenue growth).

I was the founding engineer of Amazon EC2 (2005-2010).

I was the lead engineer at Nimbula.com (2010-2012), a Cloud IaaS
startup which was acquired by Oracle in 2013.

I was at Google from 2012-2016, first as Technical Lead and Manager of
Ads Serving SRE, and then Engineering Lead on the Kubernetes team
(2014-2016).

Prior to 2005, I co-founded two startups (one in the online travel
industry, the other in financial services), on both of which I served
as lead techie until they were acquired by public companies.  I have
also worked as a consultant, contractor and technical leader in the
telco, financial and retail industries.

I have an M.Sc in Computer Science.

# Highlights of What I've done on Kubernetes thus far

Initially I led the effort to get our CI Testing stuff initiated and
[working effectively](/contributors/devel/sig-testing/writing-good-e2e-tests.md), which was critical to being able to launch v1.0 successfully,
way back in July 2015.  Around that time I handed it over to the now-famous SIG-Testing.

After that I initiated and led the [Cluster
Federation](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/federation/federation.md)
effort, which has spilled over and touched many aspects of Kubernetes
in one way or another (API, Networking, Security, Scalability, Resiliency,
Testing etc).

Along the way I also helped the [Scalability folks to set some key
objectives](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-scalability/goals.md).

# How I Hope to Serve You on the Steering Committee

I am a strong believer that Cloud Computing will change the world
(even more so than it already has), and that Kubernetes is the next
big step in this exciting journey.

To realize this potential, I believe that we need to create both a
thriving, collaborative community, and freaking awesome software that
people love to use, everywhere.  We're doing pretty well in both of
these areas, but there's still a lot of room for improvement.  So I'd
like to offer my broad and deep experience, time and passion to help
us to get there.  Hopefully my track record will help to convince you
that I'm fairly good at identifying good things for us to do, figuring
out how best to do them, and getting them done.  Along the way I have
accumulated more than a few scuffs and bruises, as well as a few
victories, so hopefully I can help us to avoid some of the former.

More specifically, I'd like to help us to (amongst others):

- ensure that Kubernetes remains a fun place to develop stuff that
  people love to use.
- create effective incentives to motivate constructive, productive
  and sustainable progress.
- protect what we have built (and will build) from bad things happening.
