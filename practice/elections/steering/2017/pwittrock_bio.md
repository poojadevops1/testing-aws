# Phillip Wittrock Bio

GitHub: @pwittrock

## Problem solving style

- Incremental approach to problem solving
- Try new things - build and iterate on minimalist solutions

## What I find important

I care deeply about helping people feel positive about what they are doing and empowered to do more.
Within the Kubernetes community, I would like to focus on helping ensure contributors':

- time and contributions are impactful
- time and contributions are recognized and appreciated
- opinions are listened to and valued

## Where I see myself contributing

I believe it is important for the processes for contribution and maintenance of the project
to be well communicated and understood within the community.
I would like to be involved in areas owned by the SC such as - helping to develop a
SIG charter template, simplifying the contributor ladder, documenting resources the community has,
and helping to find a home for unowned areas of the project.

## Roles held

Since joining the community in 2015, I have made contributions in various roles
(developer, SIG-lead, docs, release manager) across the project.  Working
in these capacities has given me insight into the challenges faced throughout the project.

Areas of the project I have contributed to include: node, kubectl, service catalog, docs and release.

### Current SIG lead positions I hold

- Co-founded SIG-cli
- Co-founded SIG-release

### Emeritus SIG lead positions I have held (brief tenure)

- Bootstrap SIG-contribX
- Bootstrap SIG-docs

### Relevant non-technical contributions

- (release) Changed management role from an individual to a team with defined roles
- (release) Proposals for streamlining and automating various processes
- Published community membership ladder developed from draft (draft by Brian Grant)
- 1.4 release czar
- Participated in 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 releases
