## Background

I joined the Kubernetes community in 2016, and have contributed in a number of
capacities since:

- Core contributor of Helm
- Co-leading the Kubernetes Charts project
- Kicked off the Helm incubation process and community docs
- Co-leading SIG Apps
- Regularly speaking and advocating for Kubernetes

Prior to my involvement in Kubernetes, I have been an active maintainer of
Bitnami's open source container images. My work at Bitnami is heavily focused on
making containers and Kubernetes both accessible and easy to use.

I am honoured to be amongst the amazing group of people nominated for the
Steering Committee. If elected, my goal will be to help Kubernetes grow into a
rich and diverse community.

## Where I see myself contributing

As someone who isn't completely focused on Kubernetes core, I think an important
part of the project is the ecosystem around it. I am deeply interested in being
part of discussions, as part of the Steering Committee, to define the vision of
the project, and to decide what relevant sub-projects should be part of
Kubernetes to continue building a strong ecosystem and brand. This also means
making sure sub-projects have the resources they need (i.e. CI, documentation
websites) to succeed and promote their roles in the overall project.

The diversity and inclusivity is one of the things that I value the most about
the Kubernetes community. I think it's important that we uphold these values
when defining and practicing a Code of Coduct and refining the contributor
experience.

Another area of the Steering Committee I'm interested in is furthering the
transparency and accountability for SIGs. I believe improving the communication
and enabling more knowledge sharing will empower both community and consumers.
