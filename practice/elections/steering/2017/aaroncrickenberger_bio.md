## What I've done

I have been involved in open source projects since 2007, cloud related projects since 2009, and Kubernetes since 2015.

I co-founded SIG Testing.  I actively contribute in SIG Contributor Experience, Release, Scale.  If you attend the weekly Kubernetes Community meetings, chances are you've seen me (or at least my beard.)

I have participated in every Kubernetes release since v1.4.  I drafted release notes for [v1.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/33410) and [v1.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/pull/140).  I am a member of of the [v1.8 release team](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/blob/master/release-1.8/release_team.md).

I helped found [the kubernetes/community repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/3).

## What I'll do

[The same thing we do every night Pinky...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJYmyYzuTa8)

I will advocate for transparency and accountability in our decision making process. I will strive for simplicity and human-sized solutions to large-scale problems where possible. I will continue to push for community empowerment and ownership of key project responsibilities.  Narf.
