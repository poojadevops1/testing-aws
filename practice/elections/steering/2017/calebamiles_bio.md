### Problem solving style

I am a huge fan of ideas which simplify and unify, possibly due to my
undergraduate study of physics and mathematics. I believe that collaboration is
incredibly important and that continuous feedback on incremental solutions are
likely to produce the best outcome. I therefore try spend a lot of time talking
with people about the problems that are important to them before stepping back
to try to introduce a minimal solution based on their concerns.

### Problems that are important to me

I believe that addressing the dual challenge of communicating what everyone is
working on to other developers, and then explaining that work to users is one
of the most pressing issues for Kubernetes today.

I also believe that we need to invest in the contributor experience particularly
by better supporting new contributors with mentorship programs, especially for
the self taught, new graduates, and underrepresented communities. If we are
going to be a successful and sustainable project we need to ensure that we
maintain a healthy pipeline of new contributors while at the same time reducing
the workload for more established contributors.

Scaling contributions is another serious challenge for the project and I am very
interested in working on helping to support the effort to rethink the Kubernetes
release process.
