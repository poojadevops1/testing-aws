## SIGS

- sig-release
- sig-cluster-lifecycle

## What I have done

  - Start contributing more to Kubernetes repositories around 2018, and before that, it was more inside the companies I used to work.
  - Today I contribute more for SIG-Release, acting as a branch manager and Techinical Lead to build and release Kubernetes to the wild.
  - Contribute to all things related to Cluster API project and focus my contribution on GCP and DigitalOcean.
  - Help to onboard new branch managers in the SIG-Release and any other member who has any questions.
  - Served in the K8s Code of Conduct Committee
  - Help in the mailing list administration and help to build tools to support the organization, like the moderator words for slack and other small tools.

## What I'll do

  - I will try to get onboard contributors underrepresented by making the process more inclusive and having more formal mentorship programs and knowledge transfer.
  - I will try to keep the community safe and welcoming.
  - I will try to incentivize the attention to understaffed work, like documentation
  - Have fun with the steering committee, and try to spread the joy across all sigs.
