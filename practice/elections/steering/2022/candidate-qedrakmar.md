## SIGS

- SIG Contributor Experience

## What I have done

I got started with Kubernetes in 2016, and have been devoted to the project and ecosystem since then.  

I have previously been part of Release Team, the long lost SIG-PM, and helped the early formation of WG-LTS.  As a contributor, my rallying cry has been around non-code contributions, and I created and lead the non-code contributor subproject under SIG Contributor Experience.  As stated elsewhere, I focus on the behind-the-scenes work that doesn’t make my GitHub profile any greener. 

I’ve helped onboard new contributors through previous New Contributors Workshops, group mentoring, speaking at and running meetups (I created the Las Vegas meetup), and generally trying to remove impediments to getting people involved.  You’ll find me on the Kubecon Program Committee, helping run Contributor Summits all over the world, working CNCF booth duty as an Ambassador at conferences, and anywhere else that I can help people get better and become more involved.

## What I'll do

I will emphasize our priorities of People first, Project second, Company third.  Since this committee primarily operates in a human-centered role, and not really a technical role, I intend to focus on the people in our communities, whether they are not yet a contributor, are happily part of this ecosystem, or they’ve already climbed the maintainer ladder and are facing burnout.  

I will be a steward, a resource, a liaison, and a friend, providing for the health and well-being of this community, and every one of the people whose lives it touches, so this project can continue to grow and thrive.  This naturally means also focusing on inclusion and accessibility to ensure that no-one is left behind or made to feel unwelcome.
