## What I have done

I've contributed to Kubernetes in a technical capacity since 2014.
In the past seven years, I've contributed code to most areas in kubernetes/kubernetes.

Most of my focus has been in api-machinery (CRDs, the kube-apiserver), 
client/controller patterns (client-go), auth (authorization in particular).
If there was a theme to my work, I would say that it was about enabling an ecosystem to grow
on top of our project.  To that end, I have worked with many people with varying
roles across most of the sigs and inside and outside the Kubernetes project.  I have helped
them learn to use Kubernetes and I have listened to them so that I could learn what
capabilities we need to develop.

I take pride in creating solid foundations that others can build on top of with confidence.

## What I'll do

I will work to maintain a stable, trustworthy, and transparent governance structure.
I think it is important to ensure a professional working environment.

I will evaluate decisions for their impact
- to our users' confidence in the Kubernetes project
- to our contributors' ability to work on the technology in this project
- to our community's long term health
