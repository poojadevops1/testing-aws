## SIGS

- Release:
  - Kubernetes 1.25 release lead
  - Kubernetes 1.24 release lead shadow
  - Kubernetes 1.23 Release Notes Lead
- SIG api-machinery
- SIG cloud provider


## What I have done

My journey with the Kubernetes community starts in SIG cloud provider around 2020. I worked towards the effort of moving in-tree cloud providers out-of-tree. I have moved the cloud provider specific component out-of-tree and made CCM flexible for controller modification which cleared the blocker for all in-tree cloud providers. I have also demonstrated the way to leverage CCM for upcoming/existing cloud providers by demoing in SIG meetings, providing sample code, and documentation. I won the [Kubernetes 2020 Contributors Award](https://www.kubernetes.dev/community/awards/2020/). 

I am also a contributor in SIG api-machinery. I recently led the effort of promoting CRD expression validation to beta in Kubernetes 1.25 which is a great feature targeting to replace the validating admission webhook. I am also working towards expanding this power further to Admission Control.

I have led the Kubernetes 1.25 release team to a smooth release recently. In the 1.25 release, it includes a total of 40 enhancements and 16 feature blogs planned which is a new record. It went out smoothly without missing any milestones with great quality. I have coordinated across the community in order to guarantee the successful release. I also led the Kubernetes 1.23 release notes team to ensure the release notes generation, CHANGLOG info, Major Themes properly out with the release.

## What I'll do

As a Kubernetes community member, I truly appreciate the collaborative, open spirit in this community that brings so many individuals to a combined power that supports the project and the community year-round. That is also the reason I picked **Combiner** as the Kubernetes 1.25 release theme. 

Serving in the Steering Committee bears some similarities to serving in the release team, which is being a great coordinator and a great listener. Serving in the steering committee means way more than governance, financial planning, and oversight pertaining to me. It helps to maintain a healthy, long standing community. It ensures that all the voices are heard. It helps to keep delivering great stuff and continuously satisfying the users. It helps to build great relationships not only with CNCF but also with peer projects, with each SIG, with each contributor, and with the users.

I would love to contribute to this effort to the best of my abilities.
