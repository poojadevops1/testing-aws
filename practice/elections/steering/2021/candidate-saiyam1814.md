## What I have done
I have been an active part of the Kubernetes community, using it heavily, at scale, as an end-user. I have represented the usage of Kubernetes and implemented it in various large-scale projects. 

I use my role as a CNCF Ambassador to reduce the Kubernetes learning curve. I teach Kubernetes and related technologies on my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/saiyam911). I keep helping new folks in starting their Kubernetes journey and help them get started to contribute. I created the [CNCFMinutes](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5uLNcv9SibB658blGUEv18IhcMGL0dxC) series where I  pick one project from the CNCF landscape and talk through it in a few minutes. I also run a CNCF official "Certs Magic" show focussed on Kubernetes certifications.

I am an active member of the chaos engineering WG where we are trying to establish a whitepaper. The need for chaos engineering is a must for cloud native applications and infrastructure leading to the need for goals and best practices that all related projects should encompass so that users can benefit from identifying failures before they occur in production.

I also contribute to the Kubernetes distributions, including K3s and K0s, by blogging, testing new features, and filing issues.



## What I'll do
Since I got involved, I have seen the project grow, and I have been actively using and contributing in different ways. I want to take my contributions to the next level and ensure that the project goes through the proper transitions to be more scalable, secure, and resilient over time. 

My goals are to increase the number of new contributors at different levels and build a more diverse and inclusive community where contributors feel empowered and find their voice quickly. I already  work with  CNCF students community, helping them get started and pointing them in the right good first issues.
 
I will continue to advocate for K8s in my existing avenues (meetups, YouTube, blogging, talks) and emphasize helping our new contributors build "a better Kubernetes." 

I will be bringing my Kubernetes at scale experience to help in the aspects like autoscaling, auditing, and metrics that will help the project be more resilient and scalable.

I have been part of this fantastic community and used it in different roles in my career. As part of the steering committee, I would be ecstatic to contribute to the project that has made my career successful and give back more to the community.
