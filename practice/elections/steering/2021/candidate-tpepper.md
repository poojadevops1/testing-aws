## What I have done

My technical experience spans orchestration, distributed systems,
linux distribution build/release/test/update, linux kernel and drivers,
embedded systems and hardware bringup.  Across almost 30 years, I
am a full stack engineer.  In and outside of tech, servant leadership
is who I am.  I've served on multiple advisory boards for non-profit
organizations.  I am a proud parent of two amazing young adults.

My four years in Kubernetes include, eg:
- Release Team member (1.10-1.12, 1.15, 1.19)
- Patch Release Team / Release Managers member (1.13.1 - 1.19)
- SIG Release co-chair (Oct. 2018 - Nov. 2020)
- WG LTS co-chair (Feb. 2019 - Oct. 2020)
- SIG Contributor Experience: developer documentation improvements and helping
  with new contributor activities at KubeCons from (virtual) Amsterdam and
  Copenhagen to Shanghai and Seattle
- Steering elected member of Code of Conduct Committee

## What I'll do

Through my diverse background, I bring the experience of a specializing
generalist which I apply to see, foresee, and mitigate current and
future issues.  I bias toward action and decision.  But decisions
alone are often not sufficient, especially in open source.  I
facilitate thoughtful communication and consensus across project
developers, operators, users, and also vendor stakeholders.
