## SIGS

    - emeritus co-chair (8000 to 50000 contributors)
    - subproject owner: events, mentoring, communication, community-mgmt, community

## What I have done
I’ve spent the last 50 months having the pleasure to serve the upstream community in some of the following ways:
- Governance 
    - Operations: 
        - Building, growing, and maintaining our communication tools that allow for transparency and collaboration; also creating community, policy, and support systems for those who maintain them
        - Revamped quarterly community meeting structure for SIGs to annual reports which levels up work to end users; better communication of our needs
    - Policies: 
        - Drafted Steerings current policy on term limits. Term definitions and limits help our succession plans and give new voices a path forward in the project. 
        - Visibility of roles within the project on sig-governance.md and many other policies that involve inclusion and operations
        - revamped sig-wg-lifecycle.md, sig-governance.md, and more
    - Advocacy:
        - I’m here to serve. I advocate for supporting our contributors and maintainers needs/interests; sometimes these interests intersect with social and human rights movements vs pure code and engineering topics. 
- Contributor Growth and Sustainability 
    - Growing our roles and supporting it’s leadership
        - Build community for community group leaders (100+) via #chairsandtechleads, monthly meetings, onboarding, and other activities 
        - Creation of additional roles within the project and the visibility of them
    - Encouraging and drafting succession plans, identifying staffing gaps
    - How we communicate as a project; bootstrapped the current upstream marketing team to help us with outreach and guidance 
    - Creating and scaling mentoring programs (example: group mentoring) that aren’t 1:1 and/or lots of burden on owners/maintainers 
## What I'll do
In what would be my final term, I want to carry out projects still in flight and continue to progress Kubernetes forward within our values:
- Grow and sustain a community of strong leaders via:
    - more leadership training, 
    - sustainable staffing models, 
    - and advocate for their needs / reduce toil
- Communication projects: 
    - how we communicate our needs to end users and cncf community
    - Add a communications/outreach/PR wrangler or like role to Steering to make sure we’ve communicated effectively 
    - Community group health checks via annual reports:
        - Relieve the administrative burden from chairs and automate some of the process from annual reports 
- Continue to work with the entire Steering body to work on sustainable staffing with the Governing Board
