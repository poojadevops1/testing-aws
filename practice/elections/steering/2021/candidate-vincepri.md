## What I have done

The experience and contributions to the Kubernetes community span over the last 3 years, from 2018 when I first joined Heptio I immediately started contributing to a number of different SIG Cluster Lifecycle projects. Over this time, I've helped grow the subprojects and reach production maturity, we recently announced Cluster API v1.0, an important milestone for the project and Kubernetes.

Throughout my career I've been exposed to a number of different environments, both in terms of people and with technology. Working remote has also taught me the important that communication has on both inclusivity and diversity.

## What I'll do

My passion for the Kubernetes community relies on its all around diversity. This community is like no other, and our software is better because of it. By serving on the Steering Committee, I would like to work towards an even more supporting and collaborative environment.

Kubernetes is a key piece of technology in the cloud native landscape and the momentum is at all time high. Kubernetes' best feature is its community, people coming from all parts of the world working together. As a member of the Steering Committee I want to help preserve, solidify, and grow our core values.

I'd love to bring SIG, end-user, and my overall experience to the Steering Committee serving this incredible community even more.
