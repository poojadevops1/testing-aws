## SIGS

- SIG Security co-chair

## What I have done

As SIG Security co-chair, I have led a cross-SIG effort that successfully navigated a delicate feature deprecation. I have mentored and grown new contributors and leaders within the Kubernetes organization, and I have established a culture that attracts contributors via word of mouth. SIG Security is known to be a welcoming, inclusive space, and we have built that on purpose. I want to take that energy to the larger project as a member of the Steering Committee.

I have also widely raised security awareness both internally and in the larger community.

## What I'll do

Technological problems are human problems, and the health of a project has as much to do with humans as with code. Will we continue to align with what we say we value? As a member of the Steering Committee, I will work toward keeping our spaces welcoming and inclusive and strive for improvement in how we care for people, taking special care to look out for end users, non-code contributors, and other marginalized folks whose voices may not be heard as often.
