## What I'll do

One of the biggest challenges open source projects grapple with is contributor sustainability.

Thereâ€™s plenty of work we could do in this area:

- Introduce more stepping stones in the contributor ladder to bridge gaps between existing levels. 
- Increase the number of reviewers & approvers in technical and non-technical SIGs/UGs/WGs.
- Improve governance specifically around community membership.
- Nurture efforts supporting the growth of underrepresented/marginalized groups in the community.
- Encourage the growth of new project leaders via formal succession planning, mentorship cohorts, and other initiatives.
- Continue analysing the annual reports for identifying potential improvement areas across the community.
