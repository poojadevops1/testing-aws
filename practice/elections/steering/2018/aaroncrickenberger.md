## How I contribute

I helped found [the kubernetes/community repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/3).

I co-founded [SIG Testing]. I regularly participate in SIGs that have impact across the project: [SIG Architecture], [SIG Contributor Experience], and [SIG Release]. I attend the weekly Kubernetes Community meetings as Aaron of SIG Beard.

I have participated in every Kubernetes release since v1.4, except v1.11. I have drafted release notes, triaged issues, provided CI signal, and simplified the process.

In the CNCF, I participate in the [CI WG] and [Conformance WG], and have assisted with [APISnoop] and [DevStats]

## What I have done

You elected me to serve on the Steering Committee in 2017.  Here's some of the things I did with that hat on:

- ensured all repos in the project belong to a SIG
- ensured all repos in the project point to a single code of conduct
- ensured we use fewer github orgs, managed by fewer people, using documented policies
- helped onboard the code of conduct committee
- ran over half of the steering committee meetings I attended
- updated the community on steering committee activity
- reviewed SIG charters

Positions I have taken:

- decisions need to be made in public, documented mediums
- decisions should be driven and validated by data rather than gut feel
- solve today's instance of the problem before trying to solve tommorrow's class of the problem
- the steering committee's primary responsibility is delegation of decision making authority
