# How I Hope to Serve You

I strongly believe that Cloud Computing will continue to change the world in profound ways, 
and that Kubernetes is a key catalyst of that change.

I believe that we need to create both a
thriving, collaborative community, and freaking awesome software that
people love to use, everywhere.  So I'd
like to offer my broad and deep experience and passion to help
us get there.

More specifically:

- ensure that Kubernetes remains a fun place to develop stuff that
  people love to use.
- incentivize constructive, productive and sustainable progress.
- protect what we build from bad things happening.
