More about [me](https://github.com/kris-nova/me)

## Why?

I have been steadily contributing to Kubernetes since 2016, and have had a lot of success with contributing to the project.
I help organize sig-aws, founded the cluster API working group with sig-cluster-lifecycle, and have have helped usher in 20+ contributors to the project via mentoring and technical guidance.
I am a software engineer by trade, who has spent years building production systems and keeping them online. That is why I fell in love with Kubernetes - finally some folks doing it right.
Being in the steering committee would be an honor for me because it would encapsulate my 3 natural ways I contribute to the project already for my day job:

1) Project management
2) Speaking for the software AND the humans
3) Pride in the tools we build

## What I will do

I won't come up with some long list of things that I hope to accomplish because I don't think that is realistic.

If I am elected to the steering committee there are 3 things (or words) I hope to adhere to during my time on the committee:

- Calm
   - I hope to keep the project productive and peaceful. I have yet to find any situation in software that can't be managed by level headed thinking and finding a positive spin on things.
- Clever
   - Regardless of the constraints, I love solving problems -- and finding new ways to approach them. It gives me energy, and probably explains why I love mountaineering as much as I do.
- Caring
   - Open source needs more empathy. Every team, company, contributor, or org is different. It takes a special mindset to be able to consider other's needs as well as your own.
