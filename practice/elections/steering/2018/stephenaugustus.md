## How I got involved with Kubernetes...

In 2015, I worked at a startup that was just starting to dip their toes into containerization. We wanted to find a platform that was extensible, supportable, and had a high rate of community adoption. 

Enter Kubernetes. 

I drove the initiative to rebuild our infrastructure on Kubernetes, primarily using CoreOS tooling.

Fast-forward a few years to my tenure at CoreOS. It was my first time directly contributing to open source technology.

I'm hooked now. I'm so enraptured with you, the community, that makes this project so vibrant and successful.

## How I serve the community...

In all I do, I try my best to find ways to improve the project through understanding and elucidating our governance principles.

Currently, I serve as:
- Product Management Chair
- Features Lead for the Kubernetes 1.12 Release Team
- SIG Azure Chair

I also shadowed the Features role for the Kubernetes 1.11 release cycle.

## What I plan to do as a Steering Committee member...

- Strive to continue removing friction from the contribution process, especially for new contributors
- Mature processes that increase our reviewer / approver base
- Drive deeper adoption of the [KEP] process project-wide
- Nurture efforts that support underrepresented / marginalized groups in technology

## Where I work...

Red Hat, with a CoreOS heart.

### Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm humbled and honored to be considered for Steering Committee! :)
