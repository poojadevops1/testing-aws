## What I have done

I've joined the Kubernetes project back in 2019 when I was looking for some Open Source project
I could contribute to. Someone recommended me to help with the IPv6 work, that was orphan
and in an alpha state for a long time.

Since the very first day, I got more and more attracted by this project and its community, collaborating and
driving features, mainly in the networking area, and working across SIGs to improve the reliability
and the quality of the project.

Today I'm a TL for SIG Network and SIG Testing, maintainer
of [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and some other projects like [Cloud Provider Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-kind)
and [Kube Network Policies](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-network-policies).

My involvement in the project has been rewarding, both professionally and personally, as I've built
strong relationships and had a lot of fun contributing.

## What I'll do

Kubernetes, despite its age, is still a relatively young project. I'm committed to its continued growth and evolution.

As part of the Steering Committee, in addition to existing responsibilities, I would like to help on these aspects for the project sustainability and success:

- Technical excellence: The project is organised and driven technically by [Special Interest Groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md#sigs). We must ensure SIGs are healthy, able to drive new features without sacrificing quality or exceeding their complexity budget, have a clear contributor ladder that help members to grow their skills and take on more responsibility, ...
- Community: The community is the heart and soul of the project, without the active involvement of volunteers, developers, users, and other stakeholders,
this project would not be able to thrive. Inclusivity, onboard, mentoring and recognition are fundamental aspects we should focus on.
- Operational sustainability: We must track key metrics (contributions, downloads, ... ) and actively engage with the community to gather feedback and ensure the project aligns with user needs, so we can identify and mitigate potential risks.
