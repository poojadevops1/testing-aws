    *   Spyglass is the prow component intended to replace this functionality, it's been around for a few months, but we're finally at enough parity that we'd like to switch over

Paris: shoutout to @coderanger who helped us during a slack spam attack this week and created a 404 redirect to slack.k8s.io to help close the loop for people looking to join this slack for kubernetes support and community.  Also thanks to @thockin and @spiffxp for stepping in to help us on a sunday evening

    *   Kubectl plugins are stable as of 1.12 -- can extend kubectl by adding new commands with kubectl-foo binaries
        *   e.g . bespoke commands for workflow or extensions
    *   Krew -- like homebrew (brew) for kubectl
        *   Easy way to discover/install plugins, keep up to date
        *   Is plugin itself (`kubectl krew install/upgrade/remove`)
        *   Can easily package for multiple platforms (windows, linux, osx) -- just write manifest pointing at hosting location and files
        *   Doesn't support:
            *   External dependencies (e.g. python)
            *   Version skew

    *   Let's talk about project boards
    *   Creation:
        *   Per repo board: needs repo write access (eg: [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/projects))
            *   Has issues with scalability for an org of our size
        *   Org-wide board: _Any kubernetes org member _can create a [kubernetes org project board](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects)
    *   Their [permissions](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/1/settings) are very similar to repo permissions
        *   Visibility: public / private
        *   Org members: admin / write / read / none
        *   Teams: admin / write / read
        *   Collaborators: admin / write / read
        *   Higher permissions higher in the list override lower permissions lower in the list
    *   eg: [SIG Contributor Experience](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/1)
        *   Recurring standup during their meeting
        *   Permissions are locked to community-admins, community-maintainers
    *   eg: [Deflaking kubernetes e2e tests](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/7)
        *   [Umbrella issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3071)
        *   Anyone can add to it, move cards around, etc
    *   Can see activity with activity tab
    *   Columns can have (github-provided) automation presets applied:
        *   To Do
        *   In Progress
        *   Done

    *   [Coscheduling](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/34-20180703-coscheduling.md)  [Klaus Ma SIG-Scheduling] (confirmed)
    *   [slides here]
    *   Motivation: Some workloads (e.g. batch data processing) need all pods to start together
        *   If some don't start/get the right resources, everything should fail
        *   May need some minimum (softer requirement than "everything")
    *   Proposal
        *   Introduce "group name" annotation, scheduler considers all pods a group as needing to start together
        *   Can separately specify minimum start number for a group
        *   Can mark group as "restart entire group if one pod fails"
    *   Quota brings some issues (quota could block things from creating/starting)
        *   Can mark group as reserving some total amount of resources for the group
    *   Status
        *   Support in [kube-batch](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-batch) 0.2+
        *   Ongoing work: PodGroupController, Quota support, better starvation behavior
    *   Other Kube-batch features: Queues, preemption, and more

*   **Moderators**:  Josh Berkus [SIG-Release]
*   **Note Taker**: Solly Ross [Google/SIG Autoscaling]
*   [ 0:00 ]**  Demo **-- Docs Modeling Working Group Demo [Andrew Chen, @chenopsis, Dominik (dominik.tornow@sap.com)] (confirmed)
    *   Link to [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ycs1-PcnctWRC9wvSbGkM3IfL2hcguQ42wbWp15DkeY/edit?usp=sharing)
    *   Modelling how we design and look at documentation
        *   Idea:
            *   Ideally, two people who look at the same system develop the same mental model
            *   Looking a documentation, there may be encoding/decoding loss (writing/reading docs), which leads to different mental models
        *   **F**undamental **M**odeling **C**oncepts
            *   Approach to system modeling with formal models of system's structure and behavior
            *   Diagrams and formal models can help show whole-picture view
            *   Show people how things work without needing to point people at actual source code
    *   Issues with existing docs:
        *   docs are task focused (good for on-demand "how do I" type questions), but can't easily develop a coherent general picture
        *   non-obvious behavior doesn't match general mental model, docs should help fix that
    *   Process:
        *   Ongoing: Discuss models (in SIG Docs), Interview engineers, validate models, create source materiel (e.g. Medium posts) and get feedback
        *   Eventually: fold back into to k8s.io (planned for next year)
*   [ 0:13 ]** Release Updates**
    *   Current Release Development Cycle  [Aish Sundar - Release Manager]
        *   **Code freeze for 1.13 is now lifted!** Code thaw went into effect 11/28, 8pm PST.
        *   Master is now open for 1.14 development.  
        *   _Only the_ _absolute most critically urgent bug fixes_ might be cherry picked back in time for 1.13.0.

*   **Moderators**:  Jorge Castro [SIG Contribex]
*   **Note Taker**: Solly Ross (SIG Autoscaling/Google)
*   [ 0:00 ]**  Demo **--Pulumi - an OSS, k8s-native deployment orchestration engine [Alex Clemmer]
    *   Link to slides
    *   Link to repo
    *   Pulumi: open-source tools for managing cloud infrastructure
        *   Declare steady state (like Kubernetes) using programming languages like Python, Javascript, Typescript to manage the cloud repos
        *   Declare desired "outputs" to be saved for easy access (e.g. Service IPs)
        *   Schema is _exactly _kubernetes schema for Kubernetes types, etc (no special other format)
        *   Knows how interact with deployments (has concept of updates, knows that it needs to rollout, wait for rollout to succeed, only delete old objects after)
    *   Workflow for using something like RDS:
        *   Without Pulumi: deploy using one tool (e.g. terraform), then fetch connection string into secret (maybe using something else), then use in kubernetes (e.g. deploy app via Helm)
        *   With Pulumi: Declare steady state in code for everything
    *   Live demo: deploy CosmosDB + Helm chart
        *   Declare CosmosDB, exported connection string
        *   Declare secret (using normal Kubernetes schema) with connection string
        *   Declare Helm chart (deploying Bitnami Node.JS image) using secret to supply external DB
        *   How it works:
            *   Pulumi figures out dependencies automatically to figure out that CosmosDB needs to come before Secret, chart depends on secret
            *   `pulumi up` will show a "plan" of operations + Kubernetes JSON, executes plan on confirmation
        *   Can specify "stack outputs" to save from the objects generated, to fetch programmatically (e.g. IP of serving generated by Helm chart)
    *   Question
        *   How is schema generated, what happens to unknown attrs
            *   Schema is generated via OpenAPI spec based on all available versions

I've experimented to get kind working with multiple clusters so that we can use it to test federation-v2 with multiple clusters for dev and CI and I'm very impressed with it so far! I filed a few issues #110, #111, #112, and #113 that I've stumbled across in the process of doing that, but it is not a reflection of the quality of work that's been done here.

    *   Let's talk about OWNERS, /lgtm and /approve
    *   How do OWNERS files work: [https://go.k8s.io/owners](https://go.k8s.io/owners)
        *   Loosely similar to CODEOWNERS files
        *   Used to both allow and suggest reviewers and approvers (and labels)
        *   Reviewers look for code quality/sane engineering (_/lgtm_)
            *   CANNOT self-LGTM
        *   Approvers look at "does this change make sense", "does it belong here", "does it clash with other functionality" (_/approve_)
            *   CAN self-approve
    *   How to use the commands:

*   **?Moderator**:  Jorge Castro [SIG Contributor Experience]
*   **?Note Taker**: Josh Berkus [Red Hat/SIG Contributor Experience/Release]
*   [ 0:00 ]** Release Updates**
    *   Current Release Development Cycle  [1.13]
        *   [v1.13-alpha2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.13.0-alpha.2) was cut yesterday, 10/24
        *   We are currently in Enhancement freeze with [34 tracked enhancements](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3Av1.13+label%3Atracked%2Fyes&utf8=%E2%9C%93) 
        *   Any further additions need to go through a formal [exception process](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/EXCEPTIONS.md)
        *   **3 weeks** to Code Freeze (11/16)
        *   Please open **test, docs PRs** and also add about **release notes** to PRs when applicable
        *   **CI Signal  **
            *   **[Test Failure Report for 10/23](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-dev/_jILqo17Suw)** 
            *   Kudos to SIG** Cluster-Lifecycle** and** Apps **for closing out some long standing failing tests ([69475](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/69475), [69356](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/69356)) !!
            *   New [Active Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TfECf8uSVnHaaCn8KTWK-sMdG3PV7jtW7FggHIUpeUU/edit#gid=781125942) for tracking test failures.  Still in development, but will be more up-to-date than the CI reports.
            *   **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Beta blocking test failures (11/6)</span>**
                *   **Master-blocking **
                    *   [Issue #69444](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/69444) -  [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling failures](https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/sig-release-master-blocking#gce-cos-master-serial). It is now critical-urgent.
                    *   [Issue #70058](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/70058) - Kubeadm failures
                    *   [Issue #69989](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/69989) - Pod SchedulerPriorities
                *   **Upgrade Test Board **
                    *   Same issues tracked in Master blocking
                    *   Tests are [generally flaky](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/70151). We continue monitor for legit failure signal, alongside deflaking attempts.
    *   Patch Release Updates
        *   [1.12.2 planned for today, 10/25](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-dev/br_xm72nSvo/discussion)
        *   Y.x
*   [ 0:00 ]**  Demo **-- Cluster API AWS Provider ([chuck@heptio.com](mailto:chuck@heptio.com))
    *   [Link to repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws)
    *   Link to slides or docs or whatever goes here. 
    *   Demo of using the Cluster API to provision AWS.
    *   CLI tool: clusterawsadm
        *   Creates IAM rules, etc.
    *   Must already have SSH key pair (does not create)
    *   Starts with an existing Kubernetes cluster to create more clusters; you have to create a 1.11 or later cluster on your own (could be minikube)
    *   Create manifests for the CRDs, using "makemanifest"
    *   Clusterctl crd then controls the cluster.
        *   Pass many parameters by switch
        *   Once the new cluster is created, moves the ClusterAPI to that cluster.
    *   Secrets?  In the CRD defintions.
    *   Config file for ClusterCTL?   Not sure.

    *   [Good idea / Bad idea](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/814/1*VM4QgVeRrlBxGyvk4F1snw.png)
        *   Good idea: explaining why you're putting on the hold
        *   Bad idea: removing a hold in a PR you're not involved in
    *   Reasons to hold
        *   Hang on, I the reviewer, think this needs more discussion
        *   I, the author, am holding this and will remove it when I've heard from the people I want
        *   I think the author should have final say on when this PR merges
    *   Notes:
        *   Anybody can add or remove a hold (don't even need to be an org member)
        *   Can we blacklist?  We can, from the org
            *   We'd have to restrict hold to org members if it was a problem

*   Last Quarter:
    *   Topology Aware Volume Scheduling
        *   Make scheduler smarter about where storage is
        *   Used to be a per-storage hack, now an expressible constraint for the scheduler
        *   Started in 1.10, added CSI support in 1.12, beta soon
    *   Snapshot & Restore
        *   Started a year ago.  Was a question whether it should be part of the API at all.  But many DB admins would like it.
        *   Mapping declarative to imperative was hard.
    *   CSI to GA this quarter
        *   PV support is primary
        *   Also want to support ephemeral volumes, and block volumes
        *   Now, we need to migrate the in-tree storage to CSI plugins.  This is a blocker for Cloud Provider migration.
            *   Challenge: end-users need to have a smooth transition
        *   Working on reusable libraries for common storage (iSCSI etc.) that can be used as templates
        *   Adding conformance testing for CSI
        *   GA depends on completing Kubelet registration mechanism
        *   We're extrating the mount library in k/k to a separate repo so that CSI driver authors can use it.
    *   To beta this quarter:
        *   Ephemeral volumes
        *   CSI Topology
        *   CRD automated installation
        *   In-tree Block Volume support
*   Catch up with SIG-Storage at their biweekly meeting, or at Kubecon
    *   Sessions in Seattle, also a "Cloud-native Storage Day"
*   As part of moving to GA, they need a more robust mechanism than user-modifiable CRDs.  THis includes addressing the downgrade problem.

    *   Current Release Development Cycle  [Tim Pepper ~ Release Lead]
        *   Release today!   ...expect published artifacts by ~5pm Pacific
        *   Pengfei Ni / @feisky (slack) /  [@feisker](https://github.com/feiskyer) (github) is 1.12.y patch manager.
        *   Any issues need targeted for cherry pick to 1.12.1 asap.

        *   No 1.10, 1.11 updates
        *   1.9.11 Mehdy Bohlool
            *   released today, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">final update</span> to 1.9.  
            *   "Finish Him!"
            *   Time to upgrade if you haven't...1.10, 1.11, 1.12 will now be our active releases.
*   [ 0:00 ] **Graph o' the Week **[Aaron Crickenberger]  How to analyze your test failures...
    *   Triage dashboard: [https://go.k8s.io/triage](https://go.k8s.io/triage) clusters for analysis the past week's worth of failures.
        *   A bunch of BigQuery data is created from GCS buckets.   (This is a publicly accessible BigQuery data set, custom analysis charges your personal Google project.)
        *   Various interactive UI elements allow tunneling into more details.  Can search GitHub for already existing issue(s) referencing an issue you're looking at.  Clicking on a failed test takes you to gubernator logs, which include at the top a command to reproduce the specific test job.  
        *   In the past automation tried to open issues, in hopes that they would get fixed, but that hasn't worked well...needs human interaction and inspection.  Toggles allow looking at CI, PR, or both.
        *   See video for live examples of how/where to click on things in the UI for chasing details of a specific failure.

        *   Apache Spark 2.4 Release coming mid to late October with Kubernetes functionality:
            *   python and R language support
            *   Client mode for spark-shell and notebooks
            *   Mounting volumes, emptyDri, hostPath, PVC
            *   Executor memory request control improvements (fractional values, milli-CPUs)
            *   Scheduler backend robustness improvements
        *   Future work:
            *   Pod templates for driver and executor pod customizations.  There are so many options configurable...explosion.  Rather than adding more, they're adding template support to make usage easier.
            *   Service shuffling
            *   Kerberos authentication
            *   Improving support for local application dependencies on the client machines doing submissions
            *   Driver resilience, checkpoint/restart for streaming applications.
        *   Non-Spark, other projects:
            *   Airflow 1.10: new operator and executor for arbitrary pods to run tasks.  Operator for life cycle management (newly open sourced)
            *   Spark Operator: exporting jvm/driver/executor metrics to Prometheus
    *   SIG Scalability [Shyam Jeedigunta] (tentative)
        *   Governance: charter is in place, giving official guidance on what the SIG can and can't do (eg: in the past there's been a lot of question around what is and is not release blocking)
        *   Test resources: github issue (link?) exists to track work items ahead of shifting underlying test resources to CNCF
        *   SLOs: API call latency and pod startup latency have been the only two for quite some time.  Looking to add multiple new ones for networking.
        *   Cluster loader ([link](https://github.com/kubernetes/perf-tests/blob/master/clusterloader/docs/design.md)): have achieved minimal viable product (MVP) level of readiness.  This should enable other teams to easily run scale tests themselves.
        *   CI health / tests: Working to speed up pre-submits' running time, as these have historically been the slowest and are a merge bottleneck (eg: kubemark 500 is waay faster).  Investing in de-flaking scale jobs like the 5000 node test, which recently had 8 green runs in a row (a record?).
        *   1.12 release: as typical, close to the end of the release some scalability issues came up, this time in:
            *   taint node by condition feature which lead to notably slower start up.
            *   CoreDNS regression was masked by other regressions until very late in the release cycle, leaving insufficient time to debug safely and feature dropped (CoreDNS is not the default on GCE yet..1.13?)

        *   Looking at cloud providers in core code, like Google, AWS, etc.
            *   Don't want more in the upstream code
            *   Want level playing field
            *   In the process of moving providers to plugins
            *   Minimum requirements to add a provider, is it documented? Do they post results to testgrid? So that users have some assurance that they'll have a positive experience. 
        *   In 1.12:

                *   Many in-tree providers use internal APIs, so code needs to be refactored.
                *   Some APIs need to be moved to staging
        *   In 1.13:
            *   Continue work to move in-tree providers
            *   Document external provider usage, need to make sure all requirements etc. are documented.  Installation process is more complicated, for example.
            *   Maybe moving provider SIGs into SIG-CP, likely to take longer.
            *   Make sure all providers have conformance test results
        *   Collaboration
            *   SIG-Docs doesn't want to be in charge of provider docs, that should be up to SIG-CP
            *   Working with Cluster Lifecycle on install/upgrade
        *   Q: should provider repos be in the Kubernetes org?
            *   A: the decision on whether providers should be part of the kubernetes org is an Arch decision, it's a question of what you think Kubernetes is.  We're trying to provide a level playing field.  Right now, they are part of the org.

                *   Charter in progress due to complex processes we manage, so there are not many defined subprojects yet. 
            *   Manage policy and governance
                *   API governance (guidance docs and the review process)
                *   Deprecation policy

            *   No schema change allowed
            *   Register a webhook to do a schema change
            *   All the various API definitions should have the same feature set

        *   "We don't own your API" - we're not the API reviewers
            *   We do own _some APIs_ like metadata format, CRD API, webhook interface APIs, comms between aggregator & APIs, controllers, RBAC API, controller shell (informer, reflector, shared informers, etc.), controller manager binary
        *   Upcoming:
            *   rate limits, flow control - prevent API quota over-consumption ~ de facto prioritization of API requests
            *   Internal API Server coordination - e.g. how do you know when every API is serving the same version of a CRD

        *   Support for multiple identity providers (Github example)
        *   Libraries for auth for javascript, Java.  Supports general SAML libraries for other languages, also working on a goal-based proxy provider.
        *   Support for external user stores (LDAP, Kerberos, Custom)
        *   Multiple identity providers per Realm, can also have database-backed identity database locally.

*   [ 0:15 ] **Graph o' the Week **[spiffxp]
    *   Let's talk about our automation's GitHub API Token usage
    *   We get: 5,000 requests per hour
    *   We used to work around this in mungegithub by:
        *   keeping an in-memory cache
        *   tuning munger polling frequency
        *   separating into SQ/misc-mungers instances
    *   Switching to prow to do things on demand vs. a polling loop helped, for a bit
    *   Now, we're using [ghproxy](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/ghproxy) (thanks @cjwagner!)
        *   Implemented by our own Cole Wagner
    *   Hero charts: last 6 months of [cache](http://velodrome.k8s.io/dashboard/db/github-cache?refresh=1m&orgId=1&from=now-6M&to=now) and [github token usage](http://velodrome.k8s.io/dashboard/db/monitoring?orgId=1&from=now-6M&to=now)
        *   See population of the cache, how many api tokens we didn't have to use over time
        *   Turned in on mid-May
        *   Prior to turning the cache on, we often hit max tokens, esp. At the end of code freeze
        *   Now usage is much more stable/lower, can go through the backlog faster
        *   We're moving away from mungegithub so you won't see this much more, [moving to Tide for merging](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/3866).
*   [ 0:22 ] **KEP o' the Week powered by SIG PM<sup>?</sup>**
    *   tallclair@ - [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/sig-node/0014-runtime-class.md) 0014-runtime-class
    *   RuntimeClass - Define a generic way for a runtime to be defined, where in the past it was opaque to the control plane beyond kubelet 
    *   Motivation is to support new runtimes, like katacontainers, GVisor and maybe future stuff like serverless runtimes or GPUs
    *   There's a podspec for the RunTimeClass, to decouple the configuration and node-level implementation from the name users need to use
        *   We could end up with more than one class spec for the same runtime
    *   See list of Non-Goals, we're trying to keep the mechanism simple. They do have a list of future extenions, though, such as:
        *   PodOverhead, so that you can account for resources outside those used for the container, like for Kata.
        *   Policies for abstract runtimeclasses in podspec, such as a requirement for a "sandbox" runtime or "unix" (pod doesn't care which specifically they get)
    *   Want to make it consistent to express supported/unsupported features (including mutually exclusive ones on a node like SELInux vs. Apparmor).

    *   Testgrid - [presubmits-kubernetes-blocking#Summary](https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/presubmits-kubernetes-blocking#Summary)
        *   Show's blocking tests
        *   Also a dashboard for non-blocking tests
        *   Can click to see history of job runs in a grid, where they succeeded and failed
        *   Tests are considered failing until it sees a pass in some particular window
    *   Velodrome - [BigQuery Metrics](http://velodrome.k8s.io/dashboard/db/bigquery-metrics?orgId=1) - [Presubmit Failure Rate](http://velodrome.k8s.io/dashboard/db/bigquery-metrics?panelId=11&fullscreen&orgId=1)
        *   Grafana instance looking at test failures
        *   Can see which suites are failing over time
            *   E.g. kops spiked, integration built over time, but has been fixed (thanks @janetkuo!)
    *   GitHub Query -[ is:open label:kind/flake org:kubernetes](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Fflake+org%3Akubernetes+archived%3Afalse+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
        *   Can use this query to find flaky tests (intermittently failing and succeeded)
    *   GitHub Query - [is:open label:kind/failing-test org:kubernetes](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Ffailing-test+org%3Akubernetes+archived%3Afalse+sort%3Aupdated-desc+)
        *   Can use this query to find tests that are failing all the time (as opposed to "just" being flaky)
    *   Who should be helping fix these?
        *   1. Who owns the test?
            *   <code>[<strong>sig-foo</strong>] thing should not explode</code>
        *   2. Who owns the job?

*   [ 0:00 ]** Release Updates**
    *   Current Release Development Cycle  [Tim Pepper ~ 1.12 Release lead]
        *   We are roughly halfway through the ~12-13 week release cycle for 1.12, but almost ? of the way through our open development phase:
            *   It's been ~50 days since master branch reopened from 1.11's freeze
            *   It is only 26 days to 1.12's code freeze!
        *   1.12.0-beta0 is Aug. 14:  We are validating a new build/publish mechanism and its documentation.  Beta should be cut from a newly created 1.12 release branch next week, CI will be enabled on the branch, and the branch will fast-forward regularly pulling master branch's content for the next weeks.
        *   Looking for high SIG attention toward keeping CI signal green for [release master blocking](https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/sig-release-master-blocking) and [release master upgrade](https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/sig-release-master-upgrade)
        *   **Code Freeze:		September 4**		(26 days from today)

        *   1.9.10 (5 days ago)
        *   1.10.6 (12 days ago)
        *   1.11.2 (1 day ago)
*   [ 0:00 ] **SIG Updates**
    *   SIG Scalability [Shyam Jeedigunta] (confirmed)
        *   Recent work toward improving tools for scale testing:
            *   "Clusterloader" rewrite (in [perf-tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/perf-tests) repo) for declarative cluster setup and measurements. [[Discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-sig-scale/2G6lNidNuaU)] Thanks @sejug for the awesome initial version of the tool.
            *   "perfdash" (code also in [perf-tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/perf-tests) repo) dashboard output to [http://perf-dash.k8s.io/](http://perf-dash.k8s.io/)
        *   For 1.12 kubelet watches for secrets instead of polling, making a big perf win, can scale to a 100k namespaces currently. 
        *   Kubelet heartbeat changes to reduce etcd interactions (see [KEP 0009 node heartbeat](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/sig-node/0009-node-heartbeat.md))
            *   Moving node heartbeat to another API
            *   Current node heartbeat produces a LOT of etcd version history, bloating the etcd database
        *   CI Testing
            *   Deflaking our jobs
            *   Solving 1.12 regression

Feel free to use the sig-architecture mailing list to reach out to us. (Slack is too ephemeral, please use the list as the primary point of contact.) 
        *   Pushing back on newly compiled-in APIs, reviewing those more closely.
        *   Will post to k-dev on the engagement model for interacting with API changes ? **important**

            *   Project-wide tip, kubernetes-sigs is the repo that holds things for SIGs that shouldn't be in core but need to be managed by SIGs. It's the evolution of the old kubernetes incubator module. 
    *   SIG AWS [Nishi Davidson] (confirmed)
        *   Slides link
        *   Looking to upstream more, especially documentation and testing
        *   Repos now in kubernetes-sigs namespace
        *   Giving an overview of subprojects:
            *   [Aws-iam-authenticator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator), allows authentication against IAM credentials for kubernetes running on AWS. Renamed from heptio-authenticator.
            *   [Aws-alb-ingress-controller](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller), created by CoreOS and Ticketmaster & donated, watches for ingress events on kubernetes and creates AWS ALBs.  It's in production at Ticketmaster (also used by Bluejeans & Freshworks).  At some point will be added to Amazon EKS.
            *   [Aws-encryption-provider](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-encryption-provider) provides envelope encryption for Etcd, still an alpha project where they are debating design elements.
            *   [Aws-csi-driver-ebs](https://github.com/bertinatto/ebs-csi-driver/) allows the CSI driver to work with EBS for PVs.  Collab with Red Hat.  Hope to make stable in 1.13/1.14 and replace the current EBS driver.
            *   Pod-identity-access: just a proposal right now.  Would like to have identity injection inside the pod for IAM credentials.  Target for 1.13/1.14 work.
            *   Cloud-provider-aws:  project to move AWS cloud provider to the cloud provider API (as per [KEP 0019](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/sig-cloud-provider/0019-cloud-provider-documentation.md)).  Added a documentation KEP for it.

    *   [Steering Committee Elections 2018](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/63)
    *   Walked through how a meeting works:
        *   [kubernetes/steering project board](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/projects/1)
        *   They start with a kanban board and look at all of the things they were supposed to have done
        *   Right now they're supposed to be having elections, but there are pending tasks that weren't done a year ago, like deciding who is a "member of standing".  
        *   Went over criteria for member of standing.  Right now they're planning to use Devstats criteria for contributions by contributor ([rolling window 1year](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/13/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All)), requiring 60 contributions.
        *   Need to [codify SIG liaisons](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/64) from SC.  This is partly for the charter process.  Have at least 2 people assigned to each SIG.
    *   Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC): open candidates, closed voting -> [set of members added in community repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2498).  See [committee readme](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/committee-code-of-conduct) for more info.

    *   Meet Our Contributors - Steering Committee edition
        *   Sep 5th at 1pm PST -> sarahnovotny, bgrant, quinton-hoole, spiffxp, jbeda, michelleN, derekwaynecarr

        *   [Meet Our Contributors ](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/meet-our-contributors.md)info
    *   Non SC participation: Would like to allow non-SC members to join the meetings by invitation (meetings are recorded though and posted to the youtube channel for community review), such as Jaice who has been auditing the meetings and asking questions.  Another example is cblecker querying the SC about GH permissions management, and made a proposal for it.  Not suggesting making the meetings open, joining would be by invitation, usually based on a proposal to the SC.

*   [ 0:00 ]** Release Updates**
    *   Current Release Development Cycle  [Tim Pepper ~ 1.12 Release lead]
        *   v1.12 Feature Freeze: was Tuesday July 31
            *   This was feature definition (not implementation) deadline.
            *   ~50 features captured
            *   Implementation (code, test cases, docs drafts)deadline is "Code Freeze" on Sept. 4
        *   v1.12.0-alpha.1 release cut yesterday Aug. 1.  Is a major milestone in that along with 1.11.1 we are transitioning from Google employees running the build/release mechanism to community members.  The transition has had a few issues, but is rapidly improving.  Expecting first beta to be smooth.
        *   More details and links at [http://bit.ly/k8s112-release-info](http://bit.ly/k8s112-release-info) 
    *   Patch Release Updates
        *   1.11.2 Scheduled for the Aug 11th (cherry picks should be up by Friday, August 3rd)

    *   Dynamic Audit Configuration [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/0014-dynamic-audit-configuration.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/0014-dynamic-audit-configuration.md)
        *   Advanced auditing is still difficult to configure
        *   Working on making it similar to dynamic admission control
        *   Support both static runtime configuration via flag and new dynamic method
        *   Moving into alpha in 1.12, beta in 1.13
        *   Will be Feature Gated
        *   Can be used to compute API coverage on a running cluster.  Previously it was not possible to alter the audit config of a running cluster.  Dynamic audit config allows you to turn on API coverage calculator and compute the API usage for a period of time.
