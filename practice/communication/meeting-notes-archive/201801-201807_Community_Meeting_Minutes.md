*   **Moderators**: Chris Short [ContribEx]
*   **Note Taker**: Solly Ross, Josh Berkus
*   **Demo:** EKS - Bryce Carman - [Amazon EKS] (confirmed)
    *   Managed Kubernetes on [https://aws.amazon.com/eks/](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
    *   Provisioning
        *   Control plane is hosted/managed by EKS, worker nodes are under control of users
            *   No outside communication with the control plane besides via the load balancer in front of the API server
            *   Can use security groups to limit control-plane-worker-node interaction
        *   Can set role used to create various AWS resources (like loadbalancers) so that you don't have to give EKS full permissions in your account
        *   Can just use VPC and subnets already present in account
    *   Networking
        *   CNI plugin
        *   Usines IP addresses from VPC that the nodes are already part of (integrated with AWS networking)
        *   No overlay network
        *   Can integrate with Calico network policy as well
        *   Designed to isolate control planes from nodes as well
    *   Interaction
        *   Using Heptio authenticator and 1.10 for external authentication for kubectl in order to authenticate against AWS IAM
        *   Just uses the same creds as the AWS CLI -- no separate auth to manage
    *   Demo'd using Helm to create a wordpress site
    *   Questions
        *   Can users scale control plane?
            *   No
*   **Release Updates**
    *   1.12 - Tim Pepper - Confirmed
        *   **Feature Freeze Tuesday July 31** - next week
            *   [see email on k-dev for more info](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/kubernetes-dev/T-kIHtgS5J4/discussion)
            *   After Tuesday features not captured by the release team must go through the **[exception process](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/blob/master/EXCEPTIONS.md)**.
            *   SIGs should be thinking about their release themes (major work focuses) for the 1.12 release, insuring those are represented in feature issues and have plans for documentation and test coverage.
            *   Not code freeze (that comes later)
    *   1.11.x - Anirudh Ramamathan - Confirmed
        *   Nothing to report
*   **KEP o' the Week **- KEP 17 - Jordan Liggitt - Confirmed
    *   [KEP 17 - Moving ComponentConfig API types to staging repos](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/sig-cluster-lifecycle/0014-20180707-componentconfig-api-types-to-staging.md)
    *   Taking config for core kube components from loose flags to structured config
        *   Kubelet currently has a config file format that's in beta
        *   Makes it easier to look at exactly how a particular component is configured, warn about deprecated config, missing config, etc
    *   Want to put configuration types in separate repo
        *   Tools like kubeadm should be able to import config to manipulate and generate, without pulling in all of Kubernetes
    *   Want to make sure common configuration aspects can be shared, referenced, and reused
        *   client connection info
        *   Leader election
        *   etc
    *   Look over if you are involved in developing the Kube components, or have tooling that sets up the various components
*   **SIG Updates**
    *   Auth - Jordan Liggitt - Confirmed
        *   [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MAIypro-bcLC7wNEnIazYqmCL6ILBN69uUWIBw7QBIY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MAIypro-bcLC7wNEnIazYqmCL6ILBN69uUWIBw7QBIY/edit?usp=sharing)
        *   Usability
            *   Multiple Authorizers (e.g. GKE)
                *   Now honor superuser permissions from other authorizers, so if you're a superuser, you can create policy without first explicitly granting yourself those permissions
                *   Now show the error message from all authorizers, instead of just the error from the first authorizer
                *   Show a much cleaner, more succinct and readable error message for failures due to escalations
        *   Features
            *   Kubelet Certs
                *   Better support for delegating to an external credentials providers (e.g. AWS IAM)
                *   Requesting and rotating certs with the CSR API (still requires external approval process for the CSRs)
            *   Scoped service account tokens
                *   Moving towards beta for time-limited and audience-scoped tokens
            *   Audit improvements
                *   Heading towards v1 audit event API
                *   Work ongoing on dynamic audit webhook reg
    *   Instrumentation - Frederic Brancyzk - Confirmed
        *   Heapster deprecation ([https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/blob/master/docs/deprecation.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/blob/master/docs/deprecation.md))
            *   Setup removal in 1.12, completely removed as of 1.13
        *   Node metrics work still ongoing, in collaboration with SIG Node
            *   Improve monitoring story around node monitoring
            *   Chime in if you maintain a device plugin or node component
        *   Metrics-server rework ([https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server/pull/65](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server/pull/65))
            *   call for testing in non-production servers, should make things more stable, has several fixes to communication with nodes
        *   k8s-prometheus-adapter advance configuration merged
            *   Allows more precisely controlling how metrics in the custom metrics API map to Prometheus queries, and how metrics show up in the custom metrics API
        *   A number of third party service involving e2e tests have been put behind a feature flag in the test infrastructure
            *   should improve flaking tests from sig-instrumentation, especially around components that we can't control
*   **Announcements**
    *   **Shoutouts **(mention people on #shoutouts on Slack)
        *   Manjunath Kumatagi for patiently working through issues that will help us run conformance tests on other architectures (say `arm64`). It's taken a really long time to get this far and the end is in sight. Thanks for your hard work across multiple repos and sigs.
        *   Jordan Liggitt for always knowing the answer to ... everything ... and being so available to answer questions. You're an incredible resource and I'm always grateful to lean on you when I need to!
        *   Quinton Hoole for including a "how you can contribute" slide in the SIG Multicluster update in today's community!  Way to model SIG leadership in growing the k8s team by facilitating new/increased participation!

        *   Goals
            *   Solving common challenges releated to managing multiple clusters
            *   Applications that run across multiple clusters
        *   Subprojects
            *   Cluster Federation (v2) [[https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/federation-v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/federation-v2) ]
                *   Work across different clusters, same or different cloud provider
                *   V1 was a POC, won't be developed further
                *   V2 focuses on decoupled, reusable components
                *   V2 has feature parity with v1, is alpha
                *   Highlights
                    *   CRDs for control planes, installed in existing cluster
                    *   Generic impl for all kube types (including CRDs) for propagating any types into all clusters, with basic per-cluster customization
                    *   Several higher-level controllers, for example:
                        *   migration of RS and deployments between clusters
                        *   Managing federated DNS

                    *   Uses cluster registry
                *   Next steps
                    *   Federated status
                    *   Federated read access (e.g. view all pods across all clusters)
                    *   affinity/anti-affinity for bunches objects or namespaces to a particular cluster
                    *   RBAC enforcement
                *   Please comment if you have suggestions for API, before moves to beta
                    *   Contributions to code also welcome
            *   Cluster Registry [[https://github.com/kubernetes/cluster-registry](https://github.com/kubernetes/cluster-registry) ]

                *   Look at repo for more information
            *   Questions
                *   Cluster registry vs cluster API?
                    *   Cluster API is to create clusters, cluster registry is for using already-existing clusters
                    *   Maybe could disambiguate the terms better, manage overlap
    *   SIG Scheduling (Bobby Salamat, confirmed)
        *   1.11 Update
            *   Pod Priority and Preemption to beta, available by default
                *   Improved the feature, restricted a bit to avoid allowing untrusted users to create high-prio pods, only allow super-high-priority pods in kube-system namespace
            *   DaemonSet scheduling in default scheduler (alpha)
        *   1.12 Update
            *   Focus on performance
                *   Improved equivalence cache (pod with similar spec probably fits on same node unless the node has changed)
                    *   3x performance improvement now
                    *   Helps with scheduling large replica sets, etc
            *   Working on proposal for gang scheduling [link here]
            *   Proposal for scheduling framework, direction might change a bit [link here]
            *   Moving to beta
                *   Taint by condition, taint-based eviction
                *   Equivalence cache
                *   DaemonSet scheduling in default scheduler
            *   Want to graduate descheduler out of incubator
*   **Announcements**
    *   **Shoutouts **(mention people on #shoutouts on Slack)
        *   Jeremy Rickard: Shout out to @mbauer for really pushing to make service catalog use prow and to improve out PR reviewing and testing process
        *   Christoph Blecker: Two shoutouts I wanted to get out this week:
            *   First, shoutout to @matthyx who has been very active in k/test-infra recently and has been making a number of different contributions from fixing bugs, to adding new features to our automation. He's been eager to help and has stuck with some of the more complex changes that require many comments and interactions (sig-bikeshed ftw :bikeshed:)
            *   Second, shoutout to @nikhita! I could easily stop right there, as her many contributions to the project really speak for themselves. I want to call out though the little chopping wood and carrying water tasks she does that may not be as obvious.. like ensuring that stale issues are reviewed and either closed or marked as still relevant, or welcoming new contributors with an emoji or two. It's these kinds of things that exemplify what the Kubernetes community is all about.
        *   Benjamin Elder:  shoutout to @Quang Huynh for continuing to send k/test-infra fixes and push through to flesh out the PR status page (especially https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/8612) long after his internship! :simple_smile: Hopefully we can hopefully start using the Prow PR status page more widely now thanks to all the hard work there :tada:
        *   Aaron Crickenberger: shoutout to @bentheelder for helping push kubernetes v1.11.1 images out (fixing the symptom), and getting the appropriate folks within google involved to ensure there is now a team owning a better solution to the problem (fixing the problem); this is continued progress toward decoupling google.com as a requirement for releases

    *   For cleanup of frequently created & dropped objects
        *   We don't have a good way to garbage collect items which no longer have an owner.
        *   Often people update-and-replace instead of modifying
    *   Proposal for new GC for these objects.
        *   Will be discussed in next API-machinery meeting next week (Wednesday) if you care about the KEP
        *   Will give detailed presentation there.

        *   Delivered in 1.11:
            *   Improved dynamic client, easier to use for CRD developers.  Everyone should switch to this because the old client will eventually go away.
            *   "Null CRD conversion": you can promote a CRD from one version to another, even though there's no API changes.  No data transformation, no changes to schema.  So very limited for now.
            *   Work on feature-branch for Server-side apply.
            *   Prep work for making controller-manager start from a config
        *   1.12 work
            *   Server-side apply dry run being merged into Master
            *   Path to more advanced CRD conversion, field defaults, advanced versioning (design phase).
            *   Controller-manager moving to running from config
            *   Generic initializers as alpha.  May be superseded by admission webhooks.  If you need something in Generic Init that isn't satisfied by webhooks, speak up in their meeting to save it.

        *   Implemented caches for test runs, which is a big performance boost
            *   Reduced GH API hits by 1500/hr
            *   Bazel build cache lowered test times

        *   Simpler test Job management: now just needs a container with an entrypoint
        *   Merge workflows using Tide are implemented
            *   Plan to rollout for 1.12

            *   Clean up config repo
            *   Framework for writing bot interactions
            *   API for cluster provisioning
        *   Questions:
            *   What about archival stats on PR status dashboard?
                *   Will discuss at sig-testing meeting

            *   SIG Testing infra wasn't available back then, so now we have testgrid and a way to report tests, etc. Gives providers instructions to follow to contribute results.
            *   SIG Openstack has been pioneering this work
            *   We want all providers to do this eventually, we'll be reaching out to all the cloud providers to give them visibility that this KEP exists.
            *   Still missing some details, will address those as more experience is developed in how to do better test

            *   Like 18.03, 17.09, etc.
            *   We've had to make changes to Windows Server to make Kubernetes work well. For example, symbolic links in Windows v. Unix.

            *   Q: Unix-style symlinks in Windows?
                *   Have something similar to unix-style symlinks and hardlinks, needed to make some symlink changes to make sure you can't traverse in an insecure way.  Code either in Kubelet or Go winio library
                *   Hardlinks not recommended, stick to the symlinks.

        *   Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/YugaByte
        *   Yugabyte is a database focusing on, planet scale, transactional and high availability. It implements many common database apis making it a drop in replacement for those DBs. Can run as a StatefulSet on k8s. Multiple db api paradigms can be used for one database.
        *   No Kubernetes operator yet, but it's in progress.
    *   Answers from Q&A:
        *   @jberkus - For q1 - YB is optimized for small reads and writes, but can also perform batch reads and writes efficiently - mostly oriented towards modern OLTP/user-facing applications. Example is using spark or presto on top for use-cases like iot, fraud detection, alerting, user-personalization, etc.
        *   q2: operator in the works. We are just wrapping up our helm charts[ https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/tree/v1.3.0/cloud/kubernetes/helm](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/tree/v1.3.0/cloud/kubernetes/helm)
        *   q3: the enterprise edition does have net new DB features like async replication and enforcing geographic affinity for reads/writes, etc. Here is a comparison:[ https://www.yugabyte.com/product/compare/](https://www.yugabyte.com/product/compare/)
        *   q4: You cannot write data using redis and read using another API. Its often tough to model across api's. Aim is to use a single database to build the app, so support common apis
        *   The storage layer is common
        *   So all APIs are modeled on top of the common document storage layer
        *   The API layer (called YQL) is pluggable
        *   Currently we model Redis "objects" and Cassandra "tables" on top of this document core, taking care to optimize the access patterns from the various APIs
        *   We are working on postgres as the next API

    *   Link to repositories: [https://github.com/argoproj/argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo)
    *   Argo: a fancy job controller for workflows, DAGs implemented as CRD.  Originally intended for CI/CD pipelines, but is seeing usage for other workflows like machine learning.
    *   Used with kubeflow
    *   Component architecture interfacing wsith k8s api server and leveraging sidecars in pods for workload artifact management
    *   Argo command line gives validation of commands, but is effectively a kubectl wrapper
    *   Workflows can be defined as a top down iterative list of steps, or as a DAG of dependencies

*   **Demo:** [Gardener Demo](https://gardener.cloud) ([vasu.chandrasekhara@sap.com](mailto:vasu.chandrasekhara@sap.com) and [rafael.franzke@sap.com](mailto:rafael.franzke@sap.com))
    *   [_occurred towards end of video instead_]
    *   Open Source: [https://gardener.cloud/](https://gardener.cloud/)
    *   Mission
        *   Manage, maintain, operate multiple k8s clusters
        *   Work across public and private clouds
    *   Architecture
        *   Self-hosted
        *   Kube-centric
        *   Steps
            *   Boot initial "garden" cluster using kubify ([https://github.com/gardener/kubify](https://github.com/gardener/kubify), open source)
            *   Deploy Gardener to "garden" cluster + dashboard (Gardener is extension API server)
            *   Run/use "seed" cluster to run control plane components, terraformer for each cluster "shoot" cluster (1 seed per hosting platform, region, etc)
            *   Each set of control plane components corresponds to a "shoot" cluster with actual nodes (machine controller + machine API objects control this)
            *   VPN between "seed" cluster and "shoot" clusters so that API server, monitoring can talk to node
    *   Secrets are created for each shoot to easily download kubeconfigs, etc
    *   Declarative config for each cluster ("shoot") with status info as well
    *   Uses cluster API machine resources, working with Cluster API WG
    *   Q: is it stable, or in development?
        *   A: used internally, but still in development
    *   Q: baremetal support?
        *   If there's an infra API that can be used to control baremetal, then that can be used

                *   A: Maybe use a Firmament-like approach?
                *   Q: is this a step along the way for perf optimization on the current schedule?
                *   A: Engineers from Huawei are working on this, but ran into issues with things like pod-antiafinity, actually binding the pods

        *   Q: Limitations on scalability come down to etcd perf, do we work with etcd engineers?
            *   A: Perf is generally not an etcd issue wrt bottlenecks
            *   A: Etcd tends to be regressions across etcd versions, not etcd as bottleneck

    *   Artifactory in Kubernetes - Jainish Shah ([jainishs@jfrog.com](mailto:jainishs@jfrog.com)), Craig Peters ([craigp@jfrog.com](mailto:craigp@jfrog.com))
    *   Artifactory is a universal repository/artifact manager (e.g. docker registry, helm repositories)
    *   Can be deployed via Helm ([https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/artifactory](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/artifactory))
    *   Can proxy/mirror/cache upstream repositories, and store artifacts itself
    *   Demo shows:
        *   creating docker registry and helm repos, pushing helm chart
        *   CLI and web UI
        *   Caching upstream repositories

        *   Is HTTP basic auth the default
            *   Yes, but other auth schemes are supported
            *   Use of the API key in the jfrog cli documented [https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory)

    *   1.9
*   **Graph o' the Week **(Josh Berkus)
    *   PR Workload: shows weighted workload for each SIG in the form of PRs.  Primarily there to check up on which SIGs are heavily loaded.  
        *   Includes ONLY PRs against kubernetes/kubernetes because other repos don't use SIG labels consistently.
        *   "Absolute Workload" == PR count * PR Size
        *   "Relative Workload" == (PR Count * PR Size) / Number of Reviewers
        *   [Calculation in issue (docs later)](https://github.com/cncf/devstats/issues/68)
        *   PRs that were *open* during that period, not PRs that were created during the period.  Old PRs are important for workload.
    *   Chart:
        *   [All PRs, 6 months](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/33/pr-workload?orgId=1)
        *   [SIG-Scalability And Autoscaling last 3 months](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/33/pr-workload?orgId=1&from=now-90d&to=now&var-sigs=autoscaling&var-sigs=scalability&var-full_name=Kubernetes)
        *   [SIG-Node last 3 months](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/33/pr-workload?orgId=1&from=now-90d&to=now&var-sigs=node&var-full_name=Kubernetes)
    *   Table:
        *   [Workloads for last month](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/34/pr-workload-table?orgId=1)
        *   [Workload for version 1.9](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/34/pr-workload-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=v1.8.0%20-%20v1.9.0&var-period=anno_28_29)
        *   [Workload for version 1.10](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/34/pr-workload-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=v1.9.0%20-%20v1.10.0&var-period=anno_29_30)
    *   Questions
        *   Assumes proper labeling
            *   Yes, things without sig labels aren't included
            *   Size labels have a lot of fudge factor
            *   Don't compare small increments ("10% more PRs than last week") but compare heavily loaded/lightly loaded ("is SIG-API overwhelmed for 1.11?")
        *   Overall graph takeaway?
            *   Determine if one SIG has a bunch of PRs suddenly, or does everyone have a bunch of PRs due to a particular place in the release cycle
        *   What do we do based on these charts?
            *   We're still exploring, seeing what people think, are these helpful to people?
            *   Join #devstats if you're interested in collaborating, discussing
            *   Need to find charts that are actually useful vs just shiny
*   **SIG Updates**
    *   SIG Cluster Ops - Rob H.
        *   Updated Mission - more focused on building operator community
        *   We have been having trouble with quorum and need some help
        *   Chris McEniry and I believe strongly in the need for an vendor neutral place for operators to gather around K8s.  Neither of us are vendors, so we're good neutral hosts, but we need help getting speakers.
        *   We'd be happy to host long format demos by vendors.
        *   Questions:
            *   Consolidate with OnPrem?
                *   Sure!
                *   It's good to consolidate SIGs if it's relevant
    *   SIG Docs - Zach
        *   2 new maintainers, 5 new contributors
        *   Coming soon: improved contribution guidelines: https://kubernetes.io/editdocs/
        *   Migrating the Kubernetes website from Jekyll to Hugo: we've met with the contractor, gotten an initial estimate, and are proceeding with a target completion date of April 30
        *   Blog migration: Formerly at blog.kubernetes.io (Blogger), the Kubernetes blog now resides at kubernetes.io/blog (GitHub).  The main reason for migrating was to resolve increasing technical debt and make life easier on the blog contribution team.
            *   Thanks to test-infra for the automation that make it possible to have blog-level ownership of PRs and approvals!
        *   Questions:
            *   Tidying up contributor guidelines just for SIG docs, or Kubernetes in general?
                *   Kubernetes in general
                *   Collaborate with ContribEx
            *   Have blog posts pending review been migrated to GitHub, or do they need to be manually migrated?
                *   They will be migrated, with blog manager opening PRs as needed
    *   SIG Service Catalog - bumped to 5/24

        *   To meet our release date, the v1.10 branch must be in very good shape by the end of next week, with fixes either en route, or in queue.  
        *   **Code freeze will end on March 14th at 6PM Pacific time**, after which any additions to the 1.10 release will need to be cherry picked, in close collaboration with the release team.

*   [ 0:18 ] **Graph o' the Week [Tim Pepper; 1.10 release issue triage shadow]**
    *   Release cadence and feature activity:  what is an "issue" or "bug" or "feature" in kubernetes and Github?  We all know GitHub has an "issue" object and there are lots of k8s labels in them, but for feature it's complicated:
        *   project specific labels represent release activities and also "kind/feature"
        *   plus a GitHub object "project"
        *   plus a GitHub object "milestone""
        *   _and_ https://github.com/kubernetes/features
    *   Does the "complicated" show up in the stats?  Are features efficiently created earlier in the cycle and closed as the cycle progresses?
        *   [SIG Issues - 7 Days Moving Average - SIG Release - Kind All - With Release markers](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/000000031/sig-issues?orgId=1&var-period=d7&var-sig=release&var-kind=All&from=now-1y&to=now)

            *   You can see phases for issues tagged feature.  However, the numbers are increasing towards the end of the release instead of being front-loaded.
            *   For 1.10 we had one SIG which was notably late, trying to figure out if this was a general problem.
        *   You can see roughly 4 phases:  open beginning, feature frozen, code frozen, final stabilization.

            *   New feature in 1.9 alpha.
            *   Very useful for multiple very different workloads
            *   Example: allow production workload to push dev workload aside
        *   Performance improvements
            *   Enable equivalence cache and move it to Beta
            *   Optimize Affinity/Anti-affinity
                *   These are much slower than other predicates (like 10X)

    *   Pick a sig, for example SIG-CLI, look into [https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cli](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cli) and there are 8 different github teams for SIG-CLI which can be used issue and PR in mentions.  In the devstats then you can view: [https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/dashboard/db/sig-mentions-categories?orgId=1](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/dashboard/db/sig-mentions-categories?orgId=1) se lecting the SIG at the top an you see the usage of the git teams in mentions for that SIG.  Are all the github teams across all the sigs actually in use?  There's a TONNE of them (30 sigs x 8 teams).  Which does a person use to ping the right set of people?  This devstats graph tunnel down is the current best way to find out.  Alternatively need to discuss if these could be simplified into a smaller number of subteams, or do SIG's find the separation into subteams useful?
