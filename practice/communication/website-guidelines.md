## Community statements

Prominent notices on Kubernetes web sites (such as site-wide or front-page banners)
may be used occasionally to publish information on behalf of the Kubernetes community.
The content of those notices must be approved by the [Kubernetes Steering Committee].
Notices may remain up to 3 weeks, after which they automatically expire
and are removed unless renewed by the steering committee for additional 3 week periods.
