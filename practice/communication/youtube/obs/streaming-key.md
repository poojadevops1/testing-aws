# Obtaining a streaming key

Streaming keys are privileged and should only be given out to trusted Community members that have shadowed an existing community streamer. To minimize the risk of malicious or accidental use of streaming keys, a unique streaming key should be generated for each instance of a community-streamed event.

* Go to YouTube and switch to the Kubernetes user
* Click the icon in the top right that is a "camera with a plus sign"
* Click "Go Live"
* Set up the stream
  * If you're streaming a recurring stream, you can pick copy a previous stream.
  * If not click "NEW STREAM"
    * Fill out the form
      * Ensure "No it's not made for kids" is selected
      * Optional: If you have a thumbnail to use, upload a custom thumbnail
    * Click "CREATE STREAM"
  * Ensure the stream date/time is correctly configured.
* The stream is now set up and you should see the [YouTube stream dashboard].
  * To view the stream key, click the "eye" icon next to the stream key.
  * To copy the stream key, click the "COPY" button next to the stream key field.
