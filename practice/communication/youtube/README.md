# YouTube Management Project

The Kubernetes community is an open community. As such, numerous meetings are
recorded and shared through the
[Kubernetes YouTube] channel. Additionally, requests to live stream meetings are increasing as the
community grows.

    to improve the community.
2. Provide guidance around the processes and procedures around recording, sharing,
    processing, and streaming Kubernetes community events (meetings, for example)
    on/to YouTube (see [YouTube Channel Guidelines]).
3. Coordinate with CNCF staff as needed to improve distribution of YouTube content.
4. STRETCH GOAL: Cultivating relationships with SIG members to assist with YouTube
    content curation as a means to enable SIGs to manage content to suit their
    interests as well as the needs of the greater Kubernetes community.
