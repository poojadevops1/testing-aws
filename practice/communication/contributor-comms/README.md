# Contributor Communications

The Contributor Communications team (Contributor Comms for short) is part of the `community-management` subproject in [Contributor Experience]. View our [charter] to learn more about us.

## Purpose

To better inform the Kubernetes contributor community and highlight their work to the broader ecosystem.

## Roles
The Contributor Comms subproject uses leadership roles to organize and delegate work of varying types. Contributors who have been a part of our group for a while and who have specific interests or skills may be interested in becoming a shadow. Shadows are contributors who work closely with a specific lead with the intent of taking over the lead role. Current leads and shadows are listed in the table below.
