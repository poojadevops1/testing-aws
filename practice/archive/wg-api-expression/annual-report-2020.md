# 2020 - WG API Expression - Community Meeting Annual Reports

**What was the initial mission of the group and if it's changed, how?**

Should still be the same as outlined in our [mission statement](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-api-expression/README.md), but with a hard focus on Server Side Apply.

**What’s the current roadmap until completion?**

- Server Side Apply (GA targeted for v1.21).

    Currently the WorkGroup is mostly focused on delivering Server Side Apply.

- Our Mission Statement contains various other topics we would like to work on, but finishing and delivering
a working version of SSA is our primary goal right now.

**Have you produced any artifacts, reports, white papers to date?**

- SSA went to Beta 2 with K8s v1.18
    
    This enabled the tracking of managedFields by default on every new resource.
[There was a Blog Post about it](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/04/01/kubernetes-1.18-feature-server-side-apply-beta-2/).

**Is the group active? healthy? contributors from multiple companies and/or end user companies?**

- The group meets actively every two weeks with communication on GitHub and Slack in between.
- Contributors are from various companies, including Google, IBM, Red Hat and end user companies.

**Is everything in your readme accurate? posting meetings on youtube?**

- The readme should be accurate.
- We’re uploading videos to youtube.

**Do you have regular check-ins with your sponsoring SIGs?**

I wouldn’t say regular check-ins, but people from those SIGs are present at most meetings.
If we should have a more formal check-in, we can figure something out.
