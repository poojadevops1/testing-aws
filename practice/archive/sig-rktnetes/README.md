# The Mission
`sig-rktnetes` is focused on topics related to the integration between Kubernetes and the rkt container runtime, more succinctly referred to as "rktnetes".

This includes:
- Kubernetes and rkt integration
- Performance and scalability
- Images, package management
- Rktnetes deployments
- Issues related to monitoring (cAdvsor, Heapster, etc.)

The main objective of this SIG is to establish rkt as the go-to/default runtime choice for a Kubernetes cluster.
