# SIG Usability Charter

This charter adheres to the conventions described in the [Kubernetes Charter README] and uses
the Roles and Organization Management outlined in [sig-governance].

## Scope

The scope of SIG usability is the core end-user usability of the Kubernetes project. This covers
topics like user experience and accessibility. The goal of SIG Usability is to facilitate adoption of
the Kubernetes project by as diverse a community of end users as possible. We do this by ensuring that
each end userâ€™s interaction with Kubernetes, from discovery to successful production use is seamless
and positive. Examples of efforts include user research, internationalization and accessibility.

### In scope

#### Code, Binaries and Services

- usability of end-user facing experiences (error messages, end-to-end tasks, etc)
- accessibility guidelines for Kubernetes community artifacts, examples include:
   - internationalization of documentation in binaries and documentation
   - color choices for people with color blind-ness
   - ensuring compatibility with screen reader technology
- user interface design for core components with user interfaces.
- code for performing internationaization and other accessbility enablement.
- translations - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/translations
- internationalization - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/kubectl/util/i18n

#### Repos
The SIG owns a `kubernetes-sigs/sig-usability` repo for the purpose of documenting:

- Common end user profiles (aka personas)
- Ongoing list of research studies and findings
- Ongoing list of known needs for user research (ex: top stackoverflow questions)
- Curated research on usability best practices (ex: HCI research literature on interface usability, error message best practices)
- Templates for anybody to be able to conduct user research interviews

#### Cross-cutting and Externally Facing Processes
SIG Usability will facilitate and collaborate with other SIGs on:
- giving end users channels for proving feedback on their experience
- surveys and other feedback gathering around project usability
- documenting common end user profiles (aka personas)
- documenting common end user interactions with Kubernetes (aka user journeys)
- design elements and language guidelines for Kubernetes concepts (e.g. 'reconciliation' or 'service')
- identifying opportunities for user research and best methods to achieve (qualitative and quantitative).
- tracking adherence to required guidelines such as [WCAG which is required to sell products in Europe].
- documentation in the vein of https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/

### Out of scope

* Contributor user experience (covered by SIG-Contributor Experience)
* API Design (covered by SIG-Architecture)
* Command line tool infrastructure (covered by SIG-CLI)
* How-to guides for implementing accessible documentation (covered by SIG-Docs)
