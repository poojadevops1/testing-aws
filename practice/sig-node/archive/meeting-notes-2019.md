*   [kkmsft,patricklang] Review alternate proposal to #[84486](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/84486) discussed earlier - annotations in ImageManager with certain fields copied from PodSandboxConfig (runtimehandler). [Link ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S30VFhwdKyeuwFuGpCiN4XIIQYkScPqZZ5n_gfwWVy8/edit)

*   [jaypipes] Currently working on repro'ing this bug: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/79159
    *   I can reproduce the bug successfully but am a bit confused as to why I never see Allocatable.cpu for the node never get decremented. Is this number not intended to be decremented ever? i.e. does the scheduler keep the current number of static cores allocatable to each node in memory?

# October 8



*   [mikebrow, kad, klueska, Lantao] Support OCI hooks in Kubernetes (continue ...)
    *   Renaud Gaubert: https://github.com/containerd/cri/pull/1248#issuecomment-537366588: Can we move the device support down to container runtime, and define runtime device plugin? In this way:
        *   The device can be supported in the container runtime with lower level information, and can probably avoid arbitrary OCI hooks, which is hacky;
        *   The same logic can be shared by Kubernetes, Docker and podman etc. instead of having different implementations in each.
        *   Containerd knows better how to support different runtimes, e.g. runc, kata, gvisor etc.
    *   Jiaying:
        *   The idea sounds reasonable to GPU, we may want to think about other plugins and general Kubernetes use cases.

# October 1



*   [mikebrow, lantaol] Support OCI hooks in Kubernetes:
    *   Containerd issue: https://github.com/containerd/cri/issues/405
    *   WIP Containerd PR: https://github.com/containerd/cri/pull/1248, basically the current idea is to model OCI hooks similar with seccomp/apparmor profile:
        *   The OCI hook details are defined on the node in hook config files (profiles). The reason is that OCI hooks run in the [host (runtime) namespace](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/config.md#posix-platform-hooks), so it is very specific to the node environment, e.g. it may directly invoke binaries in the host filesystem.
        *   Each group of OCI hooks is referenced by a name (hook name, similar to seccomp profile name or runtime handler);
        *   What hooks to run is from CRI, and Device Plugin will be the only user right now.
    *   cri-o approach: 
        *   oci-hooks are defined on the node via set of [json files](https://www.mankier.com/5/oci-hooks). 
        *   Hooks are executed when the condition is met. 
        *   Container annotations that are passed down from CRI to OCI can be used as a condition. Device Plugins can set those annotations. 
    *   Use cases:
        *   https://speakerdeck.com/kad/extending-kubernetes-with-intel-r-accelerator-devices
        *   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VNIDKgRnn1dL9hnNdaaTdiJFrEGDAhROVJAHMOyingI/edit?usp=sharing
            *   Device plugin:
                *   It doesn‚Äôt handle container restart
                *   Not enough information
                *   Cleanup the device
        *   [Inspektor Gadget](https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget) use OCI hooks and would like OCI annotations with pod uid, container id and pod labels (see [slide 15](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i8csKAf15j3ZDeHxuUlHBDvHiBI44_UxATdaaAy-pjE/edit#slide=id.g5da9f7933e_0_51) and [notes](https://hackmd.io/El8Dd2xrTlCaCG59ns5cwg?view) from OCI meeting) [@alban]
        *   Main feedback we get about the device plugin interface:
            *   Not full container lifecycle is under control, e.g. cleanup the device after container exits; response: (if runc‚Äôs hook types are insufficient we should bring that to the runtime spec team as an issue) 

                We should be able to enable all hook types at the CRI runtime layer.

            *   Lack of information. Most of the information can be retrieved by Kubelet, but not passed into device plugin yet.

*   [klueska] Limiting the supported socket count when TopologyManager enabled
    *   HintProviders (in the worst case) need to enumerate all possible socket masks and generate hints for them \
	‚Üí results in 2^n -1 masks, where n is the number of sockets \
	‚Üí state explosion for large number of sockets
    *   What is the best way to safeguard against this?
        *   Fail the kubelet if the machine has more than (e.g.) 8 sockets and TopologyManager is enabled?
        *   Wait until a pod with topology aligned resources tries to launch and fail the pod without attempting to enumerate the socket masks?

*   [jaypipes] Request a status update on [node-level userspace remapping work](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/127) from either @derekwaynecarr or @vikaschoudhary16
    *   Is this stuck waiting on reviews? Stuck on implementation or design debate? Is there anything that EKS team members can contribute to speed this along?
    *   There are resource constraints on RH side, plus it's de-prioritized. Jay will reach out to the customer who is asking about this feature and determine if there is an alternate solution to the problem and whether the user ID remapping solution would be solving the problem fully in a unique way for the customer. EKS team may contribute resources to reignite Vikas' original PR if customer feels user ID remapping is the most viable solution (and EKS team feels the proposed implementation is viable as well)

(@patricklang) This broke Windows tests across the board from 4/12 to 4/14 when we set DOCKER_API_VERSION to override it, but could have been prevented with testing ([PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12010) with /test trigger in review). Can we get someone to help push this PR through so /test works and we can prevent this next time?
    *   What about pinning Docker API version so revendoring doesn‚Äôt change it?

*   Add [maxInitialFailureCount](https://github.com/matthyx/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/20190221-maxInitialFailureCount-health-probes.md) to health probes (@matthyx)
    *   target for v1.15
    *   Next Step: find reviewers from sig-node for this KEP

    *   Code Tracking Issue here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/72828
    *   since the code freeze for v1.14 is coming in two days, this feature should target for v1.15.
    *   Next Step: update kep to reflect the delay
*   RuntimeClass beta update [@tallclair] - Summary of changes requested in API review & implications for upgrades.
    *   move RuntimeClass API from CRD to a core API, since CRD is not fully ready yet; previously existing RuntimeClass objects will need to be created;
    *   rename `runtime_handler` to `handler`, and make the `handler` field as required; this only affects RuntimeClass objects; the RuntimeClassName field of PodSpec can still be left empty;
    *   node e2e tests will be added for beta; no conformance tests will be added for now;
*   do we currently track the review effort from the sig-node side for the sig-windows PRs for v1.14 (@Patrick)?
    *   currently, we don‚Äôt. The process for v.14 is very fluid. Please ping sig-node if help is needed.
    *   We will improve this for v1.15
*   Runc memory issue: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/1980 
    *   Fix under review: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/1984
    *   Basically, instead of copying the runc binary into memory or `/tmp`, it creates a temporary read-only bind mount into runc state directory to avoid extra memory usage. 
    *   The fix is still under review.

*   [Separating a CRI for docker from Kubelet](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kubernetes-sig-node/0qVzfugYhro/l6Au216XAgAJ) (@dims)
    *   Previous SIG Node decision: container runtime is part of the os distro and node image. In the future, the container runtime in the test infra is provided and supported by the os distro and node image vendors. (@DawnChen)
    *   There is no rush to make decision on this since many productions are still depending on DockerShim even both cri-containerd and cri-o are productionized. But it is worthy talking about the current status and the goal. (@DawnChen)
    *   Sig-windows wants to move to cri-containerd as fast as possible. Some features only exist in cri-containerd, and hard to add into dockershim, e.g. some RuntimeClass features. (@Patrick)
    *   It is not the time yet to make the decision, we probably need another year. (@Derek)
    *   We already started adding features not supported by dockershim, and there will be more, e.g. secure pod, runtime class. At least if people agree on that we are going to eventually deprecate dockershim, we can continue adding this kind of features. (@yujuhong)
    *   Looking at about a year deprecation clock, once blockers are satisfied.
    *   We can start thinking about and document dockershim deprecation criteria. That doesn‚Äôt need to wait until the clock timer starts. (@yujuhong)
    *   Would really like to see this in a KEP showing how it lines up with graduating RuntimeClass, getting CRI to 1.0, and giving time for other runtimes to catch up that should be a well communicated part of sig-node roadmap (@Patrick)
    *   Who will be the advocate for when we know this is the right thing to do?
    *   Who can drive the KEP? @resouer volunteered to write a KEP for this. (@DawnChen)
    *   Next Step: we will come back to this topic one month after the KEP is sent to the community. (@DawnChen)
*   Follow up discussion on [pod resource overhead issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/688)/[RFC doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EJKT4gyl58-kzt2bnwkv08MIUZ6lkDpXcxkHqCvvAp4/edit#heading=h.b24dqducgii8) (@egernst)

    *   introduce a pod overhead to the PodSpec, which will be taken into account along with the container requests.  This will be populated automatically by an admission controller, which utilizes the values from RuntimeClass CRD.  Would like to intercept Kubernetes 1.15 as a separate feature.
    *   Why not just add pod level resource limit/requests? (@Derek)
    *   Next step: continue the discussion on the KEP

Specifically need two questions for SIG Node clarified at to reach ‚Äúimplementable‚Äù status: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/710#issuecomment-457745480:
    *   Is the proposal in the KEP to add (alpha, feature-gated) code in kubelet/dockershim to drive CRI behavior from the pod annotation considered acceptable?
    *   Is there a goal to reconcile the capabilities of the pod API, the CRI API, and the OCI spec? if so, has there been discussion about what that would look like (and if what this KEP proposes looks like it could align with that)?
*   Status Note: Windows stable graduation criteria are also in a KEP [743](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/743) which is in final review to be marked implementable for 1.14. Yu-ju & Dawn Reviewing, already have multiple rounds of updates made based on feedback from Brian Grant & Yu-ju.

    *   ReplicaSet controller should know about the pod failure
    *   Controllers should be smarter to handle these errors and backoff
    *   If an user is using sysctl then it is assumed they are breaking the containers and pod boundaries that kubernetes endorses
    *   Ideal to solve it at the controller level than at the kubelet level
