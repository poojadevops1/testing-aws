# SIG Node Meeting Notes (2020)

## Future

* `regular resource usage tracking resource tracking for 100 pods per node` =&gt; this e2e test has been failing (flaking?) quite consistently in release-blocking dashboards. Should we block the 1.14 release on this? If not, could you help resolve it? [Issue:75039](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/75039) (@mariantalla)
* Issue to discuss: [Hardware topology awareness at node level (including NUMA)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/49964)
* OCI Hooks PreStart, PostStop - @alban
  * Suggestion to add Kubernetes labels in the OCI State ([slide 15](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i8csKAf15j3ZDeHxuUlHBDvHiBI44_UxATdaaAy-pjE/edit#slide=id.g5da9f7933e_0_51))
  * Use case: [Inspektor Gadget](https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget)
  * Previous presentation at the OCI meeting, July 24th: [notes](https://hackmd.io/El8Dd2xrTlCaCG59ns5cwg?view) ; [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i8csKAf15j3ZDeHxuUlHBDvHiBI44_UxATdaaAy-pjE/edit)
* Issues to discuss:
  * [Handling timeouts on calls to CreateContainer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/94085)
  * [Redirect container stdout / stderr to file](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/94892)
* Can hugepages be handled like other namespaced sysctls?
* Can [this project](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) be considered under sig-node?

* [@rata]: Friendly ping to review [sidecar pre-proposal from Tim Hockin](http://bit.ly/thockin-pod-lifecycle-phases-proposal)
  * Next steps?
  * Discussing issue with the init containers and where the pod takes it’s state from. Maybe we need more check points and instead of runtime telling the status we need to keep the status in the kubelet. Kubelet knows way more about the status. So kubelet will not mirror runtime’s understanding of containers state into the API.
  * Dawn - yes, with the checkpoint side cars will be a reality. Dependency are needed.
  * Derek: I want to emphasys there are people working on making what we have working and reliable that needs to be appreciated.
  * Dawn: GC behavior is also not very well defined and needs to be formalized or even redesigned.
  * Derek: what’s missing in proposals is a confident implementation proposal that will make things better rather than more unreliable.
  * Sergey: we need to try to agree on the north star and split it into the road map later. Mrunal: have a feeling that the north star is a DAG. Rodrigo: maybe more phases and custom phases would be a better north star.
  * Derek: also need to make sure we are addressing the keystone container issue where sidecar container failure must stop the main container as it provides security or something.
  * Dawn: next time lets invite Tim. Maybe not the next week, let people time to read it.
  * Dawn: very important to make sure we listed scenarios to support and scenarios that will not be supported.
* [@SergeyKanzhelev] dockershim deprecation - plan review
  * We may need to revisit the plan of not compiling dockershim in 1.22 in end of Jan when we will have first customers on windows and some commitments from telemetry vendors.
  * Derek, Dawn: yes, we need to make sure we are not breaking things. Pushing a few releases should be feasible.
  * Dawn: maybe even limit it to windows-only as an alternative
  * Dawn: important to keep dockershim testing in OSS so we are not breaking anybody.
  * Mike Brown: we may need to keep the tests running even when dockershim is not released with k8s, but is still in-tree (1 year after 1.22 as the current plan states). Additionally, there will be a second dockershim that is external to kubelet, see cri-dockershim project. This external shim should be able to be tested in a similar fashion to containerd/cri-o after adding proper infra impl.
* [@ehashman] SIG Node Triage meeting?
  * Have previously discussed in the past
  * Sync on current test health efforts first before adding another meeting?

  * Reminder asking for review.
* [SergeyKanzhelev] ContainerD tests: looking for volunteers (TODO: link)
* [Mrunalp] seccomp enabled by default? Provide a flag to disable
  * [Dawn] - this change will need a wide and loud notifications way ahead of the release as this default can break some vendor
  * Seccomp enabled by default already prevented some security CVE for container runtime - example is gAdvisor
  * Tim Alclair may also be interested in this topic
  * [Action] Mrunal will start writing proposal.

    * I would like a chance to pair with someone from [#sig-node](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C0BP8PW9G) to go through the conformance process for the technical debt for ‘not tested’ Node related endpoints if anyone is keen.
    * It would probably take about 30-45 minutes and the resulting k/k tickets would fully flesh out what needs to be done, and our team would likely be able to help with the test writing itself.

  * Meet David Porter! [https://github.com/bobbypage](https://github.com/bobbypage)
  * Thank you David Ashpole for being a long time maintainer!
  * [dims] main issue - cAdvisor is both - binary and library. Only library being vendored in k8s. Worked over time to reduce the amount of vendored code. The problem is whether we want to keep going like this or we can split library out of the binary. Need more exploration. Having two different owners for cAdvisor pieces will be challenging

* [@fromani] podresources concrete assignments API - quick process question
  * The implementation of one of the proposed extensions (Watch() endpoint) is very unlikely to make it (capacity). If we need to postpone it to 1.21, do we need to fix anything (e.g. amend the KEP)?

        From Alexander Kanevskiy to Everyone:  10:08 AM
        Let’s deprecate dockershim :) it is long time overdue
        From Me to Everyone:  10:09 AM
        =) containerD has the similar issue
        but I think I agree in principle
        From Alexander Kanevskiy to Everyone:  10:12 AM
        actually…. “runc exec” doesn’t have way to specify timeout
        so, OCI compatible runtime will execute something until it return
        From michael crosby to Everyone:  10:15 AM
        If you want runc exec to timeout, you need to use context.Context with a timeout then containerd should handle it when that context is canceled
        We use exec.CommandContext for all calls to external binarie
        From Alexander Kanevskiy to Everyone:  10:19 AM
        so containerd will be the one who kills “runc exec” process…. in theory that is ok, but sometimes might be not always reliable. would it make sense to integrate “timeout” functionality on the lower level (OCI runtime spec?) so it will be reliable cleaning up processes inside container
        From Me to Everyone:  10:20 AM
        Yes, I think this is the desire. Basically first question we wanted to answer whether we need to support timeouts on exec at all. Now - whatever mechanism we will have - how to introduce it in new versioin without affecting payloads. And finally we can discuss whether to start with Andrew;s PR
        From michael crosby to Everyone:  10:24 AM
        I wouldn’t think timeout in the OCI runtime spec would make sense.  The cancel of a context should unroll things correctly as exec.CommandContext does a SIGKILL
       
       
        [Dawn] maybe timeout would not lead to container restart/kill? Ideally timeout value shouldn’t be 1 second, it should be like a catch all bigger value.
       
        [michael Crosdby] let’s not have explicit default timeout at all?
       
        [Andrew] is changing default a breaking change? [Dawn] Yes, definitely
        When readiness probe relying on default of 1 second - extending it might affect user payload

* [@bmcfall] Status of exposing hugepages in pod
  * [add support for hugepages in downward API #86102](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/86102) - Closed due to inactivity
  * @kad: as a workaround for hugepages specifically, inside container it is possible to read /sys/fs/cgroup/hugetlb/\*limit_in_byte
    * @bmcfall: Thanks @kad - Followed up on slack.

    * Should Restart be the default resize policy?
    * Should RuntimeClass [should be allowed to disable in-place update](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1883/files#r448754705) so users get synchronous error. sounds reasonable to me if runtime doesn’t support this - thoughts?

  * TLDR: Consensus on deprecating the GPU metrics, as a sig we have agreed on a way to collect metrics from out of tree. Need to figure out deprecation.
  * Dawn: Make the announcement through release notes and other channel
  * Derek: Can we tie this with cadvisor vendoring in some way?
  * David: We should tie the deprecation of GPU metrics with the summary API
  * Dawn: Deprecation of the summary API started 3+ years ago (even before the CRI), could this be a baby step for the cleanup?

* [roycaihw] When a kubelet goroutine (e.g. a pod worker) panicked, kubelet should crash and restart, instead of keeping running with a non-functioning pod worker
  * [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/88915](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/88915)
  * Kubelet has a [flag](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/900143c6d490616604d2f91e979d591eb78c20ae/cmd/kubelet/app/options/options.go#L360) controlling the crash behavior, which is [defaulted](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/900143c6d490616604d2f91e979d591eb78c20ae/cmd/kubelet/app/options/options.go#L195) to not crash
    * Background:
      * The flag was introduced in [2015](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/3577)
      * We thought we made kubelet crash in [2016](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/28800#issuecomment-231911897), but we didn’t

    * KEP adds a “dockerless” tag to avoid docker/docker imports, builds kubelet without dockershim
* [smarterclayton] Looking at pod end to end latency in the kubelet with an eye on the status loop
  * The status loop is very simple and reliable (good!) but fairly slow
  * No KEP yet, gathered some feedback from ashpole and investigating
    * In an e2e run, we take about \~800s overall from time we detect a status change to the time we successfully write it to apiserver across all tests in sum
    * With some simple changes, i was able to get that down to less than 200s (which means certain types of pod operations complete a lot faster)
    * Found a few correctness bugs already in our core sync loop
      * Internal kubelet state not in sync with apiserver
      * We check the wrong cache for certain pod
      * We are depending on a live lookup to create the patch, but there is no guarantee that is up to date either
      * Kubelet is sending new data when feature flags are off (bad!)
      * Some internal safety checks in kubelet are just log messages, but potentially should be crashes (we ignored them as logs)
  * Going to move to a KEP for some improvements soon
    * “Improve pod status reporting latency and prioritize important transitions”

  * Related [PR #78635](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78635) is ready to merge (needs hold to be removed as well)
  * Related KEP [cgroups v2](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1370) needs approval

* [vinaykul] In-Place Vertical Scaling follow-up
  * KEP [updated](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1342) based on feedback from @liggitt
  * Is it close enough to merge before Jan 28 3.00 pm deadline for 1.18?
* [patricklang, kkmsft] RuntimeClass / pull annotations [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-windows/windows-runtimeclass-support.md) (#[1448](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1448)) - very close to merge, need OK from mikebrown &amp; random-liu on final version
  * propose keeping it narrow for first phase - don’t require CRI to store annotations. Just pass them down to Pull &amp; CheckIfExists.
  * second phase would allow containerd to store annotations, and pass them back. This would be needed if you want to support multiple ways of pulling and enumerating what could be the same image, eg for experimenting with pluggable snapshotters or other CRI-specific features later. This would allow the annotations to be returned from crtctl for example &lt;comments holder/&gt;

* [@SaranBalaji90] Get opinions from others on [#87252](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/87252). Adding support for disabling /logs endpoint in kubelet
  * agreement that PR should only add ComponentConfig fields (no CLI args for kubelet)
  * general approval of exposing finer-grained endpoint handlers as long as existing behaviour does not break (w.r.t enableDebugHandlers config)
* [vinaykul] In-Place Vertical Scaling follow-up
  * Moved KEP to sig-node directory
  * Awaiting review of API changes, test plan, GA criteria
  * Targeting to [merge KEPs as implementable](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1342) before Jan 28 deadline for 1.18
* [@SaranBalaji90] Discuss about KEP - [#1461](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1461/files) To implement “out-of-tree” plugin for pod admit handler. This will benefit from not needing to update k8s source code whenever we have new feature in docker/kernel versions and preventing pods that even tolerate any taints from running on custom worker nodes.

## January 14, 2020

* Update to RuntimeClass / pull annotations [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-windows/windows-runtimeclass-support.md) (#[1448](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1448)) - [@kkmsft, @patricklang]
  * Mike &amp; Lantao to review since they had feedback and suggestions on last proposal - if ok, will proceed. Dawn will /approve if they’re ok
* Container namespace targeting [#84731](https://pr.k8s.io/84731) for 1.18? [@verb]
  * Three concerns were raised:
    * How will zombies from the ephemeral container be cleaned up, if at all? For docker will they be configured automatically?
    * What's the behavior for Init Containers?
    * Is there any coordination to do with the [user namespace work](http://features.k8s.io/127)
  * @verb will send a PR updating the ShareProcessNamespace KEP to address these concerns.

  * Final changes from API review
    * New admission controller instead of subresource
    * Using list of named subresource
  * Test-plan, graduation criteria section added
  * Should we move [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-autoscaling/20181106-in-place-update-of-pod-resources.md) to sig-node directory?
    * Yes

## January 7, 2020

* [bg.chun] Asking a review for PR [#84154](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/84154) of container isolation of hugepage
  * This change enables kubelet to set hugepage limit on container level cgroup sandbox when kubelet creates a container. and it is the last piece for container isolation of hugepages on kubernetes side except docker shim. (see next step for details)
  * Writing e2e-test on top of this change is almost done. My coworker will open PR to add test suit for container isolation soon. But it has a dependency on the PR#84154 so it will be tagged as WIP.
  * next step
    * In kubernetes side, next step of this work will be adding e2e-test and updating online [document](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-hugepages/scheduling-hugepages/).
    * In container runtime side, 1) changes for cri-o are merged. 2) changes for c8d are waiting merging now. 3) For docker, it requires more effort, 1. adding hugepages field on docker configuration fields. 2. update docker vendoring in kubernetes to have new field 3. update dockershim to set hugepage limit to docker configuration.

  * @thockin approved!!
  * Next steps:
    * Update [PR 1342](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1342) with API review change
    * CRI changes review &amp; implementation plan
    * Formal SIG-Node approval, merge as implementable, and start writing code
