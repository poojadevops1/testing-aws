# Autoscaling Special Interest Group

Covers development and maintenance of components for automated scaling in Kubernetes. This includes automated vertical and horizontal pod autoscaling, initial resource estimation, cluster-proportional system component autoscaling, and autoscaling of Kubernetes clusters themselves.

The [charter](charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the Autoscaling Special Interest Group.

## Meetings
*Joining the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-autoscaling) for the group will typically add invites for the following meetings to your calendar.*
* Regular SIG Meeting: [Mondays at 16:00 Poland](https://zoom.us/j/96548204174) (weekly). [Convert to your timezone](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=16%3A00&tz=Poland).

## Concerns
* autoscaling of clusters,
* horizontal and vertical autoscaling of pods,
* setting initial resources for pods,
* topics related to monitoring pods and gathering their metrics (e.g.: Heapster)

## Demo and Presentation Guidelines

If you want to demo at SIG Autoscaling, we have some guidelines:

- Demos should talk about *open-source* projects relevant to Kubernetes autoscaling, such as:

  * Prototypes for features to be added to Kubernetes
  * Projects that fill gaps in our infrastructure that we might want to address
  * Alternative approaches to what we do now that we may want to research
 
- Demos and presentations should be geared towards a techincal audience.

- Demos and presentations should not talk about company history or background,
  except to provide context for a usecase or issue:
  
  * "We're a retail company, and people don't shop as much during at 3am, so we generally
  see patterns of traffic around times" is acceptable.
  
  * Giving a company elevator pitch is not acceptable.

- Non-demo presentations should focus on usecases and issues.  A good rule of thumb is that
  content should be relevant in some form to a design doc or KEP's motivation or background
  sections.  If it's not, it probably doesn't belong in the presentation.

- Demos and presentations *should not pitch products*.  If you want to talk about a product that's
  recently been open-sourced, focus on it from the perspective of why it's useful to the *community*.
